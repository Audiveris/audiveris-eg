        <h3>Application and installer</h3>
        <p>
            Audiveris is now made available through the <b>Java Web Start</b>
            technology.
            Any launch of Audiveris is thus performed through a program called
            <code>javaws</code> which is provided with <b>launch.jnlp</b>, 
            a file which describes how Audiveris is to be launched.
        </p>
        <p>
            The very first time Audiveris is launched, a specific companion of
            Audiveris (named "installer") is run once before the application is
            launched. The following times, only the application is launched.
            The purpose of this installer is to check the user environment and 
            install missing components as needed (additional software and data).
        </p>
        <p>
            The following diagram depicts how this is "orchestrated" by 
            <code>javaws</code>. 
            Only the relevant components are shown, especially to point out the 
            differences implied by the fact that the chosen javaws is a 32-bit 
            or a  64-bit version.
            In the diagram, the left column refers to 32-bit Java and the right
            column to 64-bit Java.
        </p>
        <p>            
            The specific version of <code>javaws</code> can be chosen:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">
                From the command line when selecting javaws from
                proper Java environment.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">
                From Audiveris desktop shortcut. 
                This depends on which javaws file the Audiveris.lnk file points
                to, and can be changed by modifying the shortcut properties.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">
                Implicitly when clicking on the "Launch" button of Audiveris
                web site: it's up to the web browser to go the 32 or 64 route.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            
            The corresponding file locations are typically those shown by 
            Windows 7, 64-bit, where both Java environments have been installed:
            "Program Files (x86)" vs "Program Files",
            "Windows\SysWOW64" vs "Windows\System32", etc.
            Roughly speaking, on a 32-bit Windows version (which can run only
            a 32-bit Java environment), the 32-bit folders have the names of the
            corresponding 64-bit folders on a 64-bit Windows.

        <h3>Internal installer architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The Audiveris installer is organized around one core package
            (com.audiveris.installer) and as many sub-packages as needed to 
            address different OSes.
        </p>

        <img src="doc-files/overview.jpg" />

        <h3>Descriptors to support OS'es</h3>

        <p>
            The bulk of Installer processing is handled by classes from 
            com.audiveris.installer package, especially:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Installer.html'>Installer</a>
                the main class which drives the installation or uninstallation,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Bundle.html'>Bundle</a>
                which handles the collection of companions to process,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Companion.html'>Companion</a>
                which handles the installation/uninstallation of a given software 
                companion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The specificities of a particular OS environment are meant to be
            implemented in a proper sub-class of
            <a href='com/audiveris/installer/Descriptor.html'>Descriptor</a> class.
            <br/>
            For example, <a href='com/audiveris/installer/windows/WindowsDescriptor.html'>WindowsDescriptor</a> 
            is the sub-class that implements the Windows descriptor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Descriptor class has been carefully designed, and should be the
            only source to be extended by subclassing, to support OS'es like
            Unix or Mac.
        </p>

        <h3>Jnlp to encapsulate JNLP services</h3>

        <p>
            The <a href='com/audiveris/installer/Jnlp.html'>Jnlp</a> class is 
            meant to hide the underlying Java Web start environment and also to
            allow the running and debugging of the Installer even without any
            Java Web Start environment available underneath.
        </p>

        <p>
            It provides a selection of JNLP services:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">BasicService for access to code base and web browser.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">ExtensionInstallerService for reporting progress of the 
                Installer to the Java Web Start,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">DownloadService which should be used to monitor downloading.
                However, it requires all potentially downloadable URLs to be 
                explicitly referred to by the JNLP file and is also said to be 
                limited to the download of .jar files 
                (while Tesseract language files  have a .tar.gz extension).
                To be further investigated.</li>
        </ul>
