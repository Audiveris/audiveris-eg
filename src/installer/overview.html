        <p>
            The Audiveris installer is organized around one core package
            (com.audiveris.installer) and as many sub-packages as needed to 
            address different OSes.
        </p>
              
        <h3>General architecture</h3>
        <img src="doc-files/overview.jpg" />
        
        <h3>Descriptors to support OS'es</h3>
        
        <p>
            The bulk of Installer processing is handled by classes from 
            com.audiveris.installer package, especially:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Installer.html'>Installer</a>
            the main class which drives the installation or uninstallation,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Bundle.html'>Bundle</a>
            which handles the collection of companions to process,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;"><a href='com/audiveris/installer/Companion.html'>Companion</a>
            which handles the installation/uninstallation of a given software 
            companion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The specificities of a particular OS environment are meant to be
            implemented in a proper sub-class of
            <a href='com/audiveris/installer/Descriptor.html'>Descriptor</a> class.
            <br/>
            For example, <a href='com/audiveris/installer/windows/WindowsDescriptor.html'>WindowsDescriptor</a> 
            is the sub-class that implements the Windows descriptor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Descriptor class has been carefully designed, and should be the
            only source to be extended by subclassing, to support OS'es like
            Unix or Mac.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Jnlp to encapsulate JNLP services</h3>
        
        <p>
            The <a href='com/audiveris/installer/Jnlp.html'>Jnlp</a> class is 
            meant to hide the underlying Java Web start environment and also to
            allow the running and debugging of the Installer even without any
            Java Web Start environment available underneath.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It provides a selection of JNLP services:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">BasicService for access to code base and web browser.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">ExtensionInstallerService for reporting progress of the 
                Installer to the Java Web Start,</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">DownloadService which should be used to monitor downloading.
            However, it requires all potentially downloadable URLs to be 
            explicitly referred to by the JNLP file and is also said to be 
            limited to the download of .jar files 
            (while Tesseract language files  have a .tar.gz extension).
            To be further investigated.</li>
        </ul>
