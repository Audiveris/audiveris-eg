/**
 * Class {@code Nest} handles a collection of {@link Glyph} instances,
 * with the ability to retrieve a Glyph based on its Id or its location, and the
 * ability to give birth to new glyphs.
 *
 * <p>A nest has no orientation, nor any of its glyphs since a glyph is a
 * collection of sections that can be differently oriented.</p>
 *
 * <p>A glyph is made of member sections and always keeps a collection of its
 * member sections. Sections are made of runs of pixels and thus sections do not
 * overlap. Different glyphs can have sections in common, and in that case they
 * overlap, however only one of these glyphs is the current "owner" of these
 * common sections. It is known as being "active" while the others are inactive
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>A nest hosts a SelectionService that deals with glyph selection
 * (Events related to Glyph, GlyphId and GlyphSet).
 *
 * <p>Selecting a (foreground) pixel, thus selects its containing section, and
 * its active glyph if any.</p>
