	<h4>Glyph Life Cycle</h4>
	<h5>Creation</h5>
	<ul>
	    <li>Many glyphs are created through the {@link
		omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#retrieveGlyphs} method which builds
		glyphs out of connected unknown sections, and then use {@link
		omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#addGlyph} to actually record the glyph
		into the lag and its containing system.</li>
	    <li>Some glyphs are created by building a compound out of other
		glyphs, by {@link omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#buildCompound}. These
		compounds have no effect until they are inserted via {@link
		omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#addGlyph}.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Insertion</h5> This is done by {@link
	omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#addGlyph} which performs the following actions:
	<ol>
	    <li>If the glyph is a compound (made of other glyphs) then its parts
		are made pointing back to the compound, they are removed from
		the system collection of glyphs, and their member sections are
		made pointing to the compound. Doing so, the former parts are no
		longer "active", only the compound is "active".</li>
	    <li>The glyph is recorded in the lag, and if found identical to some
		existing glyph, the existing glyph is returned, otherwise this
		new glyph is recorded and assigned a lag-based unique ID.</li>
	    <li>Finally, the glyph is recorded in the system collection of
		glyphs.</li>
	</ol>
	<h5>Deletion</h5> A (recorded) glyph is never totally deleted, it can be
	reused then by chance an identical glyph is inserted into the lag. This
	allows to cache the glyph parameters, moments, forbidden shapes, OCR
	content, etc.
	<p>What {@link omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#removeGlyph} does is simply:
	    <ol>
		<li>Removing the glyph from the system collection of
		    glyphs.</li>
		<li>Cutting the link from its member sections, making this glyph
		    "inactive".</li>
	    </ol>
	</p>
	<h4>Glyph display</h4> A glyph is made visible via its member sections
	(except for the "selected" glyph(s) which use a specific highlighting
	mode). Several glyphs may contain the same section, but since the
	section can point back to at most one glyph, there is at most one
	"active" glyph for any given section, the other glyphs are thus
	"inactive".
	<p>While stand-alone (i.e. non-member) sections are displayed using a
	    set of 3 different colors, so that adjacent sections can be
	    differentiated, member-sections are colorized with the same color
	    imposed by their containing glyph. Usually, the glyph color is
	    determined by the glyph assigned shape.</p>
