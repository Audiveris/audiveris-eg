            Detection of text-shaped glyphs
        </h3>
        <p>
            The general idea is to come up with glyphs that are very likely to
            correspond to real text. Such glyphs are assigned a textual Shape,
            that is either the Shape TEXT or the Shape CHARACTER. Glyph
            candidates come from several sources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#retrieveGlyphs} implements 
                standard glyph creation by section aggregation or glyph
                aggregation in a bottom-up strategy.
            </li>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.pattern.TextGreedyPattern} tries to grow 
                existing text-shaped glyphs by adding neighbors.
            </li>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.pattern.TextAreaPattern} implements specific 
                area division, starting from rectangular area at
                system level, then subdividing along horizontal and vertical 
                axes, in a  top-down strategy.
            </li>
            <li>Individual glyph assignment by user manual interaction.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Use of OCR tool
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.GlyphChecker} uses OCR content-based 
                verification of tuplet-shaped glyphs (TUPLET_SIX and 
                TUPLET_THREE).
            </li>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.pattern.TextBorderPattern} inpects the regions
                around any system (above, below, left and right) and tries to
                detect blobs that can be gathered as text-shaped glyphs.
                Note that Glyph evaluator is bypassed, and that OCR is used to
                validate glyph candidates.
            </li>
            <li>{@link omr.glyph.text.SentencePattern} gathers lines of text
                shaped glyphs, expanded with alien glyphs if any, then calls
                OCR of these "physical" lines. The resulting OcrLines are then
                used to create as many "logical" sentences, which will be 
                finally translated to score entities during the {@link 
                omr.score.SystemTranslator}.
