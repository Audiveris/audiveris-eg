        <h2>How textual glyphs are handled</h2>

        <h3>Glyphs selection</h3>

        The general idea is to come up with glyphs that are very likely to
        correspond to real text. Such glyphs are assigned a textual Shape, that
        is either the Shape TEXT or the Shape CHARACTER. Glyph candidates come
        from 3 sources:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Standard glyph creation by section aggregation or glyph
                aggregation.  This bottom-up strategy is implemented in {@link
                omr.glyph.GlyphsBuilder#retrieveGlyphs}</li>
            <li>Specific area division, starting from rectangular area at system
                level, then subdivision along horizontal and vertical axes. This
                top-down strategy is implemented in the {@link
                omr.glyph.text.TextArea} class.</li>
            <li>Individual glyph assignment by user manual interaction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Glyphs processing</h3>
        
        The special processing for textual glyphs is triggered during the
        PATTERNS step, which among other patterns, calls the {@link
        omr.glyph.text.TextInspector#runTextPattern} method.
        
        <p> Working at a system level, this method does the following:
            
            <ol><li>Retrieve additional textual glyphs (see the area division,
                as described above),</li>
                <li>Retrieve alignments of textual glyphs into instances of
                    {@link omr.glyph.text.TextLine}</li>
                <li>Process each TextLine in sequence:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure no textual glyphs overlap (see {@link
                        omr.glyph.text.Sentence#mergeEnclosedTexts})</li>
                    <li>Try to aggregate non-textual glyphs that may exist on
                        the line (see {@link
                        omr.glyph.text.Sentence#includeAliens})</li>
                    <li>Merge sentences close to each other via
                        {@link omr.glyph.text.TextInspector#mergeSentences}.</li>
                    <li>Finally, try to recognize each retrieved sentence
                        through {@link omr.glyph.text.Sentence#recognize} which
                        uses the OCR feature provided by the Tesseract
                        tool.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
