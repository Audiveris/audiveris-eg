/**
 * Interface {@code Section} handles a section of contiguous and
 * compatible {@link Run} instances.
 *
 * <p> A section carries orientation information, which is the orientation for
 * all runs in this section.
 *
 * <ol> <li> Positions increase in parallel with run numbers, so the thickness
 * of a section is defined as the delta between last and first positions, in
 * other words its number of runs. </li>
 *
 * <li> Coordinates increase along any section run, so the section start is the
 * minimum of all run starting coordinates, and the section stop is the maximum
 * of all run stopping coordinates. We define section length as the value: stop
 * - start +1 </li> </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Beware</b>, the section orientation only governs the runs orientation.
 * It by no means implies that the section dimension is longer in the direction
 * along the runs than in the direction across.
 * To enforce this, the {@link #getLength(Orientation)} requires that an 
 * explicit orientation be provided, just like for {@link Glyph} instances.
