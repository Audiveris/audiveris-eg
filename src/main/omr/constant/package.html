	Package dedicated to the handling of application-level constants.
        
	<img src="doc-files/Constant.jpg" />
	
	<p><a href="Constant.html">Constant</a> instances represent a logical
	    application constant, whose persistency is to be managed from one
	    application run to the other.</p>
	<p>A constant (and its subclasses) can be:
	    <ul>
		<li>A Constant declaration enclosed in a <a
		    href="ConstantSet.html">ConstantSet</a> instance.  This is
		    by far the most common and easiest way to define constants
		    related to specific application class.</li>
		<li>A standalone Constant defined outside the scope of any
		    ConstantSet. This case is typically used when the name of
		    the constant must be forged programmatically.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	</p>
	<p><b>Modification</b> of a Constant value must preferably be performed
	    through dedicated interfaces. You can directly edit the property
	    files, but you do so at your own risks. There are two
	    constant-related GUI within the application:
	    <ul>
		<li>The <a href="UnitTreeTable.html">UnitTreeTable</a> is the
		GUI related to the <a href="UnitManager.html">UnitManager</a>
		singleton which handles all the units (classes) for which there
		is either a Logger instance or a ConstantSet instance, or
		both. This GUI is launched from Tools | Options menu and handles
                the tree of these units.</li>
		<li>The <a href="../glyph/ui/ShapeColorChooser.html"
                >ShapeColorChooser</a> is a rudimentary GUI interface to set
                the color of each and every glyph shape.</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
	<p><b>Persistency</b> of each constant is handled by the <a
	    href="ConstantManager.html"> ConstantManager</a> singleton, which uses the
	    qualified name of the constant as the key to retrieve a related property
	    (if any) specified in either the DEFAULT and/or the USER property
	    files. Please refer to the
	    <a href="ConstantManager.html">ConstantManager</a> documentation to
	    read the details on how a constant value is determined.<br/>  Since
	    the persistency of a Constant uses its fully qualified name
	    (i.e. the path to the enclosing class, plus the name of the constant
	    element in the ConstantSet), the determination of the fully
	    qualified name is deferred until the value of the Constant is
	    actually retrieved. This is implemented through the use of a
	    DirtySet within the UnitManager.</p>
