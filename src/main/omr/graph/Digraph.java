/**
 * Class <code>Digraph</code> handles a directed graph, a structure containing
 * an <b>homogeneous</b> collection of instances of Vertex (or a collection of
 * homogeneous types derived from Vertex), potentially linked by directed edges.
 * <p/>
 *
 * <p> Vertices can exist in isolation, but an edge can exist only from a vertex
 * to another vertex. Thus, removing a vertex implies removing all its incoming
 * and outgoing edges.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTA</b>: Since we have no data to carry in edges, there is no
 * <code>Edge</code> type per se, links between vertices are implemented simply
 * by Lists of Vertex.
 *
 * @param <D> precise type for digraph (which is pointed back by vertex)
 * @param <V> precise type for vertices handled by this digraph
