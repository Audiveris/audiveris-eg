Description: optical music recognition tool written in Java.
 Audiveris is an open-source Optical Music Recognition software
 which processes the image of a music sheet to automatically provide
 symbolic music information in MusicXML standard.
 .
 This opens the door to many tools (score editor, MIDI sequencer, ...)
 which can use this symbolic data for such tasks as edit, play, print,
 re-publish, transpose, query, etc.
