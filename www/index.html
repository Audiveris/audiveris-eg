						    <h3>Project Goals</h3>

						    <p> <b>Audiveris</b> is an <b> Optical Music Recognition</b> (OMR)
							module. Starting from the image of a music sheet, it provides
							high-level logical music information compliant with the MusicXML
							definition. Other tools such as a Midi Sequencer, or a
							Composition Editor can then read and update this standard
							data.</p>
						    
						    <p> There are already commercial tools in this area but Audiveris
							is, to our knowledge, the first Java open-source OMR tool. It is
							a cross-platform tool, written entirely in Java, and tested on
							Windows, Solaris, Linux and Mac OS (Mac test is on-going).</p>
						    
						    <p> Audiveris works with printed music sheets only, the task of
							recognizing hand-written scores being significantly harder.</p>
						</td>
					    </tr>

						<td style="padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
						    <h3>Current Status</h3>
						    
						    <p>Starting with version 3.0, Audiveris is now a fully functional
							music scanner.  Since there may still be remaining errors in the
							translation, the program offers the user the ability to guide
							the translation on the fly. It can also take advantage of
							user-supplied data in order to further train its internal neural
							network, and thus improve the glyph recognition task.</p>
						    
						    <p>More detailed information is available in the provided manuals,
							but here are the main phases of the application:</p>
						    
						    <ol>
							<li>Detection and correction of potential <b>skew</b> angle of
							    the sheet,</li>
							
							<li>Removal of <b>staff lines</b>, detection of systems, staves
							    and measures,</li>
							
							<li><b>Extraction </b>of individual music
							    items, essentially based on their appearance and
							    their structure,</li>
							
							<li>Music <b>translation</b> based on the
							    extracted music items, and essentially driven by music
							    grammar,</li>
							
							<li>Manual <b> correction </b>of unavoidable remaining
							    errors,</li>
							
							<li>Export of logical music information, using the MusicXML
							    format definition,</li>
							
							<li>Finally, any other application able to read / write
							    MusicXML format can be chained to it.</li>
						    </ol>
						    
						    <p>There is still room for improvement in this program but the
							internal architecture is now fairly stable and robust enough to
							be used and augmented by people willing to contribute.</p>

							<h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>
						    </a>
						    
						    <p> Here are a few ideas of contribution that would make sense and
							be really appreciated:</p>
						    
						    <ul>
							<li>Rather easy</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Validate Audiveris on other platforms than Windows,
								Solaris or Linux. Some people volunteered
								for <B>Mac&nbsp;OS</B> (Brenton Partridge is actively
								working on it).</li>
							    
							    <li>Integrate with a <B>MusicXML player</B> such as Xenoage
								of Andreas Wenger.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<li>More significant</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Find and integrate an open-source <b>OCR</b> (Optical
								Character Recognition), preferably in Java, in order to
								handle the various text pieces (typically lyrics) which
								for the time being are simply discarded.</li>
							    
							    <li>Integrate with a <b> Visual Music Editor</b> for manual
								correction, for printing, etc. Audiveris has only an
								embedded rudimentary editor.  For example Xemo would be
								a natural partnering tool, however the Xemo site doesn't
								seem active anymore.</li>
							    
							    
							    <li>Evaluate a move to <b>NetBeans</b> (the <b>platform</b>,
								not the IDE). This would move Audiveris stand-alone
								application to a much better integration environment,
								taking advantage of view and parameter management. This
								could also ease the integration with visual
								editors.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<li>Fairly difficult</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Consider addressing <b>hand-written scores</b>. This
								domain could take benefit of a significant part of
								Audiveris framework, however this would really be a
								project on its own. To be discussed if anyone is
								interested by this daunting task.</li>
