			<p>Current version is 3.0, with a beta release published on 5-Jul-2007. With this version,

			    (please provide the scanned image with your report, to help us analyze the program
			    behavior).</p>

						    <h3>Project Goals</h3>

						    <p> <b>Audiveris</b> is an <b> Optical Music Recognition</b> (OMR)
							module. Starting from the image of a music sheet, it provides
							high-level logical music information compliant with the MusicXML
							definition. Other tools such as a Midi Sequencer, or a
							Composition Editor can then read and update this standard
							data.</p>
						    
						    <p> There are already commercial tools in this area but Audiveris
							is, to our knowledge, the first Java open-source OMR tool. It is
							a cross-platform tool, written entirely in Java, and tested on
							Windows, Solaris, Mac OS (on-going) and Linux (soon).</p>
						    
						    <p> Audiveris works with printed music sheets only, the task of
							recognizing hand-written scores being significantly harder.</p>
						</td>

						<td style="padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
						    <h3>Current Status</h3>
						    
						    <p>Starting with version 3.0, Audiveris is now a complete music
							scanner.  Since the translation cannot be perfect, since there
							may still be some errors in the translation, the program offers
							the user the ability to guide the translation on the fly. It can
							also use new translation data in order to further train its
							internal neural network, in order to improve the glyph
							recognition task.</p>
						    
						    <p>More detailed information is available in the provided manuals,
							but here are the main phases of the application:</p>
						    
						    <ol>
							<li>Detection and correction of potential skew angle of the
							    sheet,</li>
							
							<li>Removal of staff lines, detection of systems, staves and
							    measures,</li>
							
							<li><b>Extraction </b>of individual music
							    items, essentially based on their appearance and
							    their structure,</li>
							
							<li>Music <b>translation</b> based on the
							    extracted music items, and essentially driven by music
							    grammar,</li>
							
							<li>Manual <b> correction </b>of unavoidable remaining
							    errors,</li>
							
							<li>Export of logical music information, using the MusicXML
							    format definition,</li>
							
							<li>Finally, any other application able to read / write
							    MusicXML format can be chained to it.</li>
						    </ol>
						    
						    <p>There is still room for improvement in this program but the
							internal architecture is now fairly stable and robust enough to
							be used and augmented by people willing to contribute.</p>

						    <h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>
						    
						    <p> Here are a few ideas of contribution that would make sense and
							be really appreciated:</p>
						    
						    <ul>
							<li>Rather easy</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Validate Audiveris on other platforms than Windows or
								Solaris. Some people volunteered for Mac OS (Brenton
								Partridge is actively working on it) and Linux.</li>
							    
							    <li>Integrate with a MusicXML player such as Xenoage of
								Andreas Wenger.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<li>More significant</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Find and integrate an open-source <b>OCR</b> (Optical
								Character Recognition), preferably in Java, in order to
								handle the various text pieces (typically lyrics) which
								for the time being are simply discarded.</li>
							    
							    <li>Integrate with a <b> Visual Music Editor</b> for manual
								correction, for printing, etc.  For example Xemo would
								be a natural partnering tool, however the Xemo site
								doesn't seem active anymore. Audiveris has only an
								embedded rudimentary editor.</li>
							    
							    
							    <li>Evaluate a move to <b>NetBeans</b> (the <b>platform</b>,
								not the IDE). This would move Audiveris stand-alone
								application to a much better integration environment,
								taking advantage of view and parameter management. This
								could also ease the integration with visual
								editors.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<li>Fairly difficult</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Consider addressing <b>hand-written scores</b>. This
								domain could take benefit of a significant part of
								Audiveris framework, however this would really be a
								project on its own. To be discussed if anyone is
								interested by this daunting task.</li>
