		<FONT COLOR="red"><B><BLINK>NEW</BLINK></B> : A first
		    version of the source code has just been uploaded

	    <H3>Project Goals</H3>
	    <P> Audiveris is an <B> Optical Music Recognition</B>
		(OMR) module. Starting from the simple bitmap of a
		music sheet (for example by scanning a paper), it is
		able to infer the music informations the sheet
		contains. It can then provide this information to
		other tools such as a Midi Sequencer, or a Composition
		Editor, or any other tool that needs music information
		as input.</P>
		
	    <P> There are already commercial tools in this area, such
		as MusicScan or SharpEye. Audiveris will be, to my
		knowledge, the first Java open-source OMR tool.</P>
	    
	    <P> Audiveris works with printed music sheets only,
		recognition of hand-written scores is at least one
		order of magnitude harder.</P>

	    <H3>Current Status</H3>

	    <P> Audiveris is still in development, based on the
		lessons learnt from a prototype written in Ada several
		years ago.</P>

	    <P> The final version should comprise 3 main phases:</P>
	    <OL>
		<LI>Automatic <B> extraction </B>of individual music
		    items, essentially based on their appearance and
		    their structure. This is by far the most complex
		    part of the automatic tasks.</LI>
		<LI>Automatic music <B> recognition</B>, based on the
		    extracted music items, and driven by music
		    grammar.</LI>
		<LI>Manual <B> correction </B>of unavoidable remaining
		    errors. This is a rather different domain which
		    could be started in parallel (see foreseen
		    contributions below). </LI>
	    </OL>
	    <P>The development so far has mainly focused on phase #1
		(automatic music extraction) which now approaches
		completion. Development of the other two phases has
		not started yet.</P>
	    
	    <H3>Foreseen Contributions</H3>

	    <P> Here is a preliminary list of domains and tasks for
		which contribution would make sense and be really
		appreciated :</P>
	    <UL>
		<LI>Integrate with a <B> Visual Music Editor</B> for
		    manual correction, for printing, for playing,
		    etc...  For example Xemo (project as seen on
		    NetBeans) would be a natural partnering tool,
		    however the Xemo site doesn't seem active
		    anymore. So this task remains fully open.</LI>
		<LI>Use <B> MusicXML </B> as the primary vehicle
		    for exchange of music information with other
		    tools.</LI>
		<LI>Move to <B> NetBeans</B>. I'm referring to
		    the <B>platform</B>, not the IDE. This would
		    move Audiveris stand-alone application to a
		    much better integration environment, taking
		    advantage of view and parameter
		    management. This should also ease the
		    integration with visual editors.</LI>
	    </UL>
	    <UL>
		<LI>Consider addressing <B> hand-written
		    scores </B>. This domain could take benefit of a
		    significant part of Audiveris framework, however
		    this would really be a sub-project on its own. To
		    be discussed if anyone is interested by this
		    daunting task.</LI>
	    </UL>
	    
	    <H3>Current Implementation</H3>
	    
	    <P> Audiveris today is a pure Java stand-alone
		application, which represents 200 classes and 50_000
		lines of Java code.</P>
	    
	    <H5>Techniques</H5>
	    <UL>
		<LI><B> Linear Adjacency Graphs</B> (LAG), a technique
		    to record pixel information as a directed graph
		    structure, composed of pixel contiguous runs
		    organized in sections linked by junctions.</LI>
		<LI><B> Sticks </B>, a technique I developed above
		    LAGs to specifically address the structuring
		    sticks of a music sheet (staff lines, ledgers and
		    legato signs are horizontal sticks, while stems
		    and bar lines are vertical sticks).</LI>
		<LI><B> Neural Network</B>, to allow efficient pattern
		    recognition as well as training based on user
		    input for continuous improvement of the tool
		    efficiency.</LI>
	    </UL>
	    
	    <H5>Technologies</H5>
	    <UL>
		<LI><B>Java Advanced Imaging</B> (JAI) for number
		    crunching in image processing.</LI>
		<LI><B>Swing </B>for user interface,
		    with <B>JGoodies </B> enhancements.</LI>
		<LI><B>JFreeChart </B>for charts.</LI>
		<LI><B>Castor </B>for XML persistency.</LI>
		<LI><B>J2SE 5.0</B>, since generics are used wherever
		    the compiler can help.</LI>
		<LI><B>Ant </B>for project building.</LI>
