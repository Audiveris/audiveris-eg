                Audiveris is a complete music scanner going all the way from the scanned music sheet input to the
                MusicXML output.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current version 3.1 was released on 28-Jan-2008. It is focused on organizing user actions into
                plugins to ease external integration, and the MIDI interface was the first feature added through this
                mechanism.
            </p>

                Please note there is still room for external contribution, see the section below on <a href=

                Project Goals
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Audiveris</strong> is an <strong>Optical Music Recognition</strong> (OMR) module. Starting from
                the image of a music sheet, it provides high-level logical music information compliant with the
                MusicXML definition. Other tools such as a Midi Sequencer, or a Composition Editor can then read and
                update this standard data.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are already commercial tools in this area but Audiveris is, to our knowledge, the first Java
                open-source OMR tool. It is a cross-platform tool, written entirely in Java, and tested on Windows,
                Solaris, Linux and Mac OS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audiveris works with printed music sheets only, the task of recognizing hand-written scores being
                significantly harder.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Current Status
            </h3>
            <p>
                Since versions 3.x, Audiveris is a fully functional music scanner. Because there may still be remaining
                errors in the translation, the program offers the user the ability to guide the translation on the fly.
                It can also take advantage of user-supplied data in order to further train its internal neural network,
                and thus improve the glyph recognition task.
            </p>
            <p>
                More detailed information is available in the provided manuals, but here are the main phases of the
                application:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Detection and correction of potential <strong>skew</strong> angle of the sheet,
                </li>
                <li>Removal of <strong>staff lines</strong>, detection of systems, staves and measures,
                </li>

                <li>Detection of <strong>systems</strong>, staves and measures,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extraction</strong> of individual music items, essentially based on their appearance and
                    their structure,
                </li>
                <li>Music <strong>translation</strong> based on the extracted music items, and essentially driven by
                music grammar,
                </li>

                <li>Manual <strong>correction</strong> of remaining errors,
                </li>
                <li>Export of logical music information, using the MusicXML format definition,
                </li>
                <li>Direct playback using a MusicXML/MIDI interface,
                </li>
                <li>Finally, any other application able to read / write MusicXML format can be chained to the output of
                Audiveris.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                There is still room for improvement in this program but the internal architecture is now fairly stable
                and robust enough to be used and augmented by people willing to contribute.
            </p>

                <a name="Foreseen-Contributions" id="Foreseen-Contributions">Foreseen Contributions</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Here are a few ideas of contribution that would make sense and be really appreciated:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Interface</strong> is the part which should now benefit the most from external
                    contributions, since Audiveris initial design was focused on automatic processing with limited
                    edition capabilities. Contributions could address code level and/or design level. At least two
                    directions could be investigated:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Splitting glyphs</strong>: to manually isolate meaningful glyphs out of a bunch of
                            merged pixels, and then recognize their shapes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Injecting score entities</strong>: to forget about unrecognizable glyphs but
                            manually and directly insert their translation into the score structure.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Integrate with a <strong>Visual Music Editor</strong> for manual correction, for printing, etc.
                could be a way to ease user interaction. For example Xemo would be a natural partnering tool, however
                the Xemo site doesn't seem active anymore.
                </li>
                <li>Find and integrate an open-source <strong>OCR</strong> (Optical Character Recognition), preferably
                in Java, in order to handle the various text pieces (typically lyrics) which for the time being are
                simply discarded. Brenton Partridge has just sketched a first proof of concept with Google Tesseract
                OCR, so this feature could be available soon.
                </li>

                <li>Investigate support for <strong>hand-written scores</strong>. This domain could take benefit of a
                significant part of Audiveris framework, however this would really be a project on its own. To be
                discussed if anyone is interested by this daunting task.
                </li>
