	<div style="text-align: justify;">
	    <FONT COLOR="red"><B>NEW:</B> A first version of the
	    source code has just been uploaded together with a
	    starting documentation focused on installation and
	    launching of Audiveris. See the Download section
	    below.</FONT>  <br/>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Project Goals</h3>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">Audiveris is an <span
		style="font-weight: bold;">Optical Music
		Recognition</span> (OMR) module. Starting from the
		simple bitmap of a music sheet (for example by
		scanning a paper), it is able to infer the music
		informations the sheet contains. It can then provide
		this information to other tools such as a Midi
		Sequencer, or a Composition Editor, or any other tool
		that needs music information as input.
	    
	    <br/> <br/>

	    There are already commercial tools in this area, such as
	    MusicScan or SharpEye. Audiveris will be, to my knowledge,
	    the first Java open-source OMR tool.

	    <br/> <br/>
	    
	    Audiveris works with printed music sheets only,
	    recognition of hand-written scores is at least one order
	    of magnitude harder.

	    <br/>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Download</h3>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">

	    The application is composed of two archives :
	    <UL>
		<LI>Java source code, jar file and documentation files
		    are available as one zip archive : <A
		    HREF="audiveris-2.0-20050504.zip">
		    audiveris-2.0-20050504.zip</A></LI>
		<LI>XML-coded glyph information, needed to re-train
		    the evaluators, is available as a separate zip
		    archive : <A
		    HREF="audiveris-2.0-train-20050504.zip">
		    audiveris-2.0-train-20050504.zip </A></LI>
	    </UL>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Current Status</h3>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">Audiveris is still in
	    development, based on the lessons learnt from a prototype
	    written in Ada several years ago.

	    <br/> The final version should comprise 3 main
	    phases:<br/>
	</div>
	<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	    <li>Automatic <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		extraction </span>of individual music items,
		essentially based on their appearance and their
		structure. This is by far the most complex part of the
		automatic tasks.<br/>
	    </li>
	    <li>Automatic music <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		recognition</span>, based on the extracted music
		items, and driven by music grammar.<br/>
	    </li>
	    <li>Manual <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		correction </span>of unavoidable remaining
		errors. This is a rather different domain which could
		be started in parallel (see foreseen contributions
		below). </li>
	</ol>
	<div style="text-align: justify;">The development so far has
	    mainly focused on phase #1 (automatic music extraction)
	    which now approaches completion. Development of the other
	    two phases has not started yet.<br/>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>
	<div style="text-align: justify;"> Here is a preliminary list
	    of domains and tasks for which contribution would make
	    sense and be really appreciated:<br/>
	    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
		<li>Integrate with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		    Visual Music Editor</span> for manual correction,
		    for printing, for playing, etc...  For example
		    Xemo (project as seen on NetBeans) would be a
		    natural partnering tool, however the Xemo site
		    doesn't seem active anymore. So this task remains
		    fully open. </li>
		<li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		    MusicXML </span> as the primary vehicle for
		    exchange of music information with other
		    tools.</li>
		<li>Move to <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		    NetBeans</span>. I'm referring to the <span
		    style="font-weight: bold;">platform</span>, not
		    the IDE. This would move Audiveris stand-alone
		    application to a much better integration
		    environment, taking advantage of view and
		    parameter management. This should also ease the
		    integration with visual editors.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
		<li>Consider addressing <span style="font-weight:
		    bold;"> hand-written scores</span>. This domain
		    could take benefit of a significant part of
		    Audiveris framework, however this would really be
		    a sub-project on its own. To be discussed if
		    anyone is interested by this daunting task.<br/>
		</li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Current Implementation</h3>
	<div style="text-align: justify;"> Audiveris today is a pure
	    Java stand-alone application, which represents 200 classes
	    and 50_000 lines of Java code.<br/>
	</div>
	
	<h5>Techniques</h5>
	<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Linear Adjacency
		Graphs</span> (LAG), a technique to record pixel
		information as a directed graph structure, composed of
		pixel contiguous runs organized in sections linked by
		junctions.</li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Sticks </span>, a
		technique I developed above LAGs to specifically
		address the structuring sticks of a music sheet (staff
		lines, ledgers and legato signs are horizontal sticks,
		while stems and bar lines are vertical sticks).</li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Neural
		Network</span>, to allow efficient pattern recognition
		as well as training based on user input for continuous
		improvement of the tool efficiency.<br/>
	    </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>Technologies</h5>
	<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java Advanced
		Imaging</span> (JAI) for number crunching in image
		processing.<br/>
	    </li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swing </span>for user
	    interface.</li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Castor </span>for XML
		persistency.</li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">J2SE 5.0</span>,
		since generics are used wherever the compiler can
		help.</li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ant </span>for
	    project building.<br/>
	    </li>
	</ul>
