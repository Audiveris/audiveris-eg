		<p>Current version is 3.0, with a beta release published on
		    5-Jul-2007. With this version, Audiveris can now be considered as a
		    fully-fledged music scanner, going all the way from the scanned music
		    sheet to the MusicXML output.</p>
	    </div>
	    
	    
	    
	    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
	    
	    
	    <p> Audiveris is an <b> Optical Music Recognition</b> (OMR)
		module. It is a music scanner: starting from the simple bitmap
		of a music sheet (for example by scanning a paper), it is able
		to infer the music information the sheet contains. It can then
		provide high-level logical music information to other tools
		such as a Midi Sequencer, or a Composition Editor, or any
		other tool that complies with the MusicXML definition.</p>
	    <p> Audiveris works with printed music sheets only, the task of
		recognizing hand-written scores is at least one order of
		magnitude harder.</p>
	    
	    <p> There are already commercial tools in this area, such as
		MusicScan or SharpEye. Audiveris is,&nbsp;to our knowledge,
		the first Java open-source OMR tool. it is also a
		cross-platform tool, since developed entirely in Java, and
		tested on Windows, Solaris, Mac OS (on-going) and Linux
		(soon).</p>
	    <p>There is still room for improvement in this program (see below
		the foreseen contributions), but the internal architecture is
		now fairly stable and robust enough to be used and augmented
		by people willing to contribute.</p>

	    <h3>Current Status</h3>
	    
	    <p>Starting with version 3.0, Audiveris is now a complete music
		scanner which aims at automatically translating the 'pixel
		data' of a sheet of music to the high-level music information
		carried by a MusicXML file.  Since the translation cannot be
		perfect, since there may still be some errors in the
		translation, the program offers the user the ability to guide
		the translation on the fly. It can also use new translation
		data in order to further train its internal neural network, in
		order to improve the glyph recognition task.</p>
	    <p>More detailed information is available in the provided manuals,
		but here are the main phases of the application:</p>
	    
	    <ol>
		<li>Detection and correction of potential skew angle of the
		    sheet,</li>
		<li>Removal of staff lines, detection of systems, staves and
		    measures,</li>
		<li><b>Extraction </b>of individual music
		    items, essentially based on their appearance and
		    their structure,</li>	
		<li>Music <b>translation</b> based on the
		    extracted music items, and essentially driven by music
		    grammar,</li>
		<li>Manual <b> correction </b>of unavoidable remaining
		    errors,</li>
		<li>Export of logical music information, using the MusicXML
		    format definition,</li>
		<li>Finally, any other application able to read / write
		    MusicXML format can be chained to it.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	    <p>Audiveris is the result of several years of&nbsp;development at
		night, and was initially based on the lessons learnt from a
		prototype written in Ada several years ago. Development is still
		on going, and would benefit from additional contribution. We
		would also appreciate feedback of other users, in the form of
		suggestions or bug reports (please provide the scanned image
		with your report, to help us analyze the program behavior).</p>
	    
	    <h3>Foreseen Contributions</h3>
	    
	    <p> Here is a&nbsp;list of domains and tasks for which
		contribution would make sense and be really appreciated :</p>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li>Rather easy</li>
		<ul>
		    <li>Validate Audiveris on other platforms than Windows or
			Solaris. Some people volunteered for Mac OS (Brenton
			Partridge is actively working on it) and Linux.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>More significant</li>
		<ul>
		    <li>Integrate with a <b> Visual Music Editor</b> for manual
			correction, for printing, for playing, etc...  For
			example Xemo (project as seen on NetBeans) would be a
			natural partnering tool, however the Xemo site doesn't
			seem active anymore. Audiveris has only an embedded
			rudimentary editor. So this task remains fully
			open.</li>
		    
		    <li>Find and integrate an open-source <b>OCR</b> (Optical
			Character Recognition), preferably in Java, in order to
			handle the various text pieces (typically lyrics) which
			for the time being are simply discarded.</li>
		    
		    <li>Evaluate a move to <b> NetBeans</b>
			(The <b>platform</b>, not the IDE). This would move
			Audiveris stand-alone application to a much better
			integration environment, taking advantage of view and
			parameter management. This should also ease the
			integration with visual editors.</li>
		    
		</ul>
		<li>Fairly difficult</li>
		<ul>
		    <li>Consider addressing <b> hand-written scores </b>. This
			domain could take benefit of a significant part of
			Audiveris framework, however this would really be a
			sub-project on its own. To be discussed if anyone is
			interested by this daunting task.</li>
		</ul>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3>Current Implementation</h3>
	    
	    <p> Audiveris today is a pure Java stand-alone application, which
		represents about 260 classes and 85_000 lines of Java
		code.</p>
	    
	    <h5>Techniques</h5>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Linear Adjacency Graphs</b> (LAG), a technique to
		    record pixel information as a directed graph structure,
		    composed of pixel contiguous runs organized in sections
		    linked by junctions.</li>
		
		<li><b>Sticks</b>, a technique developed above LAGs to
		    specifically take advantage of the structuring sticks of a
		    music sheet (staff lines, ledgers and legato signs are
		    examples of horizontal sticks, while stems and bar lines
		    are examples of vertical sticks).</li>
		
		<li><b>Neural Network</b>, to allow efficient pattern
		    recognition as well as training based on user input for
		    continuous improvement of the tool efficiency.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h5>Technologies</h5>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Java Advanced Imaging</b> (JAI) for number crunching in
		    image processing (loading image, accessing pixel data,
		    rotating the image, etc)</li>
		
		<li><b>Swing </b>for user interface,
		    with <b>JGoodies</b>enhancements in terms of forms and look
		    &amp; feel.</li>
		
		<li><b>JFreeChart </b>for charts.</li>
		
		<li><b>JAXB 2 </b>for XML persistency.</li>
		
		<li><b>JAMA</b> for linear algebra in Java.</li>
		
		<li><b>Java&nbsp;5</b> since generics are used wherever the
		    compiler can help, and preferably <b>Java 6 </b>since JAXB 2
		    is already integrated with Java&nbsp;6 distribution.</li>
		
		<li><b>Ant </b>for project building.
		</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h5>Companions</h5>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li><b>ProxyMusic</b> is a companion project, dedicated to the
		    marshalling and unmarshalling between Java objects and
		    MusicXML files. Audiveris today uses ProxyMusic V1.1 (since
		    compliant with MusicXML V1.1) and will soon support MusicXML
		    V2.0 which Recordare has just released. Please refer to <a
		    href="https://proxymusic.dev.java.net">https://proxymusic.dev.java.net</a></li>
