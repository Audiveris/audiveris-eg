            Release Notes</A>.</P>
        <P>Next release (3.0) will address the recognition
            phase, and the storing of the results in a
            standard format (MusicXML).</P>

        <H3>Project Goals</H3>
        <P> Audiveris is an <B> Optical Music Recognition</B>
        (OMR) module. Starting from the simple bitmap of a
        music sheet (for example by scanning a paper), it is
        able to infer the music informations the sheet
        contains. It can then provide this information to
        other tools such as a Midi Sequencer, or a Composition
        Editor, or any other tool that needs music information
        as input.</P>
        
        <P> There are already commercial tools in this area, such
        as MusicScan or SharpEye. Audiveris will be, to my
        knowledge, the first Java open-source OMR tool.</P>
        
        <P> Audiveris works with printed music sheets only,
        recognition of hand-written scores is at least one
        order of magnitude harder.</P>

        <H3>Current Status</H3>
        
        <P> Audiveris is still in development, based on the
        lessons learnt from a prototype written in Ada several
        years ago.</P>
        
        <P> The final version should comprise 3 main phases:</P>
        <OL>
        <LI>Automatic <B> extraction </B>of individual music
            items, essentially based on their appearance and
            their structure. This is by far the most complex
            part of the automatic tasks.</LI>
        <LI>Automatic music <B> recognition</B>, based on the
            extracted music items, and driven by music
            grammar.</LI>
        <LI>Manual <B> correction </B>of unavoidable remaining
            errors. This is a rather different domain which
            could be started in parallel (see foreseen
            contributions below). </LI>
        </OL>
        <P>The development so far has mainly focused on phase #1
        (automatic music extraction) which has reached an
        acceptable level with release 2.3. Development of the
        phase #2 (recognition and result storing) has just
        started, but should be achieved within few weeks, and
        published as release 3.0.</P>
        
        <H3>Foreseen Contributions</H3>
        
        <P> Here is a preliminary list of domains and tasks for
        which contribution would make sense and be really
        appreciated :</P>
        <UL>
        <LI>Easy</LI>
        <UL>
            <LI>Validate audiveris on other platforms than
            Windows. Typically we should address Linux and
            Mac.</LI>
        </UL>
        <LI>Significant</LI>
        <UL>
            <LI>Integrate with a <B> Visual Music Editor</B> for
            manual correction, for printing, for playing,
            etc...  For example Xemo (project as seen on
            NetBeans) would be a natural partnering tool,
            however the Xemo site doesn't seem active
            anymore. So this task remains fully open.</LI>
            <LI>Use <B> MusicXML </B> as the primary vehicle
            for exchange of music information with other
            tools.</LI>
            <LI>Move to <B> NetBeans</B> (The <B>platform</B>, not
            the IDE). This would move Audiveris stand-alone
            application to a much better integration
            environment, taking advantage of view and
            parameter management. This should also ease the
            integration with visual editors.</LI>
        </UL>
        <LI>Difficult</LI>
        <UL>
            <LI>Consider addressing <B> hand-written
            scores </B>. This domain could take benefit of a
            significant part of Audiveris framework, however
            this would really be a sub-project on its own. To
            be discussed if anyone is interested by this
            daunting task.</LI>
        </UL>
        </UL>
        
        <H3>Current Implementation</H3>
        
        <P> Audiveris today is a pure Java stand-alone
        application, which represents about 200 classes and
        50_000 lines of Java code.</P>
        
        <H5>Techniques</H5>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Linear Adjacency Graphs</B> (LAG), a technique
            to record pixel information as a directed graph
            structure, composed of pixel contiguous runs
            organized in sections linked by junctions.</LI>
        <LI><B>Sticks</B>, a technique developed above LAGs to
            specifically take advantage of the structuring
            sticks of a music sheet (staff lines, ledgers and
            legato signs are examples of horizontal sticks,
            while stems and bar lines are examples of vertical
            sticks).</LI>
        <LI><B>Neural Network</B>, to allow efficient pattern
            recognition as well as training based on user
            input for continuous improvement of the tool
            efficiency.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <H5>Technologies</H5>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Java Advanced Imaging</B> (JAI) for number
            crunching in image processing.</LI>
        <LI><B>Swing </B>for user interface,
            with <B>JGoodies </B> enhancements.</LI>
        <LI><B>JFreeChart </B>for charts.</LI>
        <LI><B>Castor </B>for XML persistency.</LI>
        <LI><B>J2SE 5.0</B>, since generics are used wherever
            the compiler can help.</LI>
