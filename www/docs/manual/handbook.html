                    <p>
                        For Windows users, a pair of Microsoft Installer files 
                        is available in the 
                        <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/audiveris/downloads">
                            download area</a> of Audiveris project.
                        The files are named respectively
                        <code>audiveris-V.v.revision-x86.msi</code> (for 32-bit) and
                        <code>audiveris-V.v.revision-x64.msi</code> (for 64-bit).
                    </p>
                    <p>The Windows installer will take care of all needed 
                        components:
                        Application code and data, Java runtime, C++ runtime,
                        Tesseract OCR and language files, Ghostscript software,
                        musical font, etc.

                    <p>                    
                        <b>Important:</b> Download the installer that fits
                        your architecture. 
                        In the specific case of a 64-bit machine with a 64-bit
                        Java environment, make sure to use the 64-bit 
                        Audiveris release otherwise the C++ library will
                        fail to load when invoked from Java.

                        Launch the installation by a double-click on the 
                        downloaded installer file.
                        The installer presents a welcome screen.

                    <p>
                        The next screen allows to select the proper setup (typical,

                        If you select the custom setup, you have the ability to choose
                        the installation location and decide on the installation of

                        Note that you can always change your mind later and add or
                        remove some or all of these optional components. To do so,
                        simply relaunch the installer program, it will prompt you for
                        your new decisions.

                        because those don't provide pre-built binary libraries for Tesseract
                        3.02. 
                        You are assumed to be familiar with the process of compiling
                        and installing software from source. 
                        Moreover, this guide assumes
                        some basic level of familiarity with command line operation.

                        Basically, the installation of Audiveris on a particular
                        Linux distribution consists of the following steps 
                        (most of them require the user to type commands in a 
                        terminal):

                    <p>
                        At the time of this writing, Tesseract project doesn't 
                        officially provide binary packages for Linux. 
                        Therefore, you need to compile and install Tesseract 
                        libraries manually.

                                        Tesseract OCR depends on the image processing library called
                                        "Leptonica", which, in turn, depends on several image formats like
                                        JPEG, PNG, TIFF and GIF. These formats are usually supported by
                                        external libraries. You need to install the development versions for
                                        each of those libraries:

                    <p>
                        Audiveris requires Ghostscript (an interpreter for the PostScript
                        language and for PDF) in order to deal with PDF files.
                        Ghostscript is already installed by default on both
                        OpenSUSE and Fedora.
                        Audiveris requires Ghostscript 9.05 or higher.
                        To verify that, run the following command in the terminal:

                    <p> 
                        Since OCR language files can exhibit huge sizes, only

                        installation packages for Windows and Ubuntu Linux.
                        The default languages are: German (deu),
                        English (eng), French (fra) and Italian (ita).

                        The main purpose of a music scanner like Audiveris is to
                        analyze the image of a sheet of music and transcribe it to the
                        standard symbolic format that all other music applications can
                        read and write for further processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To load an image, use the menu <code>File </code> | <code> 
                            Input</code> and select some input file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another way to load an input file, is to directly use a drag n'
                        drop from the file explorer to the Audiveris application window.

                        A few hints:

                    <ul>
                        <li>All major formats are supported, notably PDF, TIFF, JPG,
                            PNG, BMP.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One input file leads to one score. 
                            One multi-page input file (PDF and TIFF formats provide this
                            feature) leads to one score composed of as many pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prefer gray level images, with pixels value in the 0 - 255
                            range, to black and white images.
                            Color images are supported as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you scan paper sheets by yourself, pay attention to the
                            scan resolution. Best results are obtained with resolution
                            around 300 DPI. Lower resolutions may hide key details while
                            higher ones turn quickly into a significant waste of CPU and
                            memory resources.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>physical</code> mode displays the sheet glyphs

                            their physical coordinates.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <code>logical</code> mode displays the logical score
                            entities built from the interpretation of the physical 
                            glyphs.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <code>combined</code> mode is a combination of the
                            physical and logical layers. It displays the logical 
                            entities in a translucent manner on top of the physical 
                            glyphs.

                        + the selected plugin.

                    Let's introduce a short number of basic concepts:

                        <dt>Pixel</dt>
                        <dd>A pixel is the smallest picture element in the input image. 
                            A pixel exhibits a specific color, generally a level of 
                            gray.
                            Using a binarization filter, we can separate foreground 
                            (rather black) pixels from background (rather white) pixels.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Run</dt>
                        <dd>A run is a horizontal or vertical vector of pixels of the
                            same kind (foreground or background).
                            A black (foreground) pixel is "assigned" to exactly one run.

                        <dt>Section</dt>
                        <dd>A section is a sequence of adjacent black runs, all of the
                            same orientation. 
                            Sections do not overlap, hence a run belongs to exactly one
                            section.</dd>

                            different orientations. A section may belong to many 
                            overlapping glyphs at the same time, but is assigned at any
                            moment to at most one (active) glyph.</dd>

                                <b>glyph</b>-based (the default) or
                                <b>section</b>-based.
                                To switch from one mode to the other, use the
                                toggle menu item <code>Views</code> | 
                                <code>Enable section selection</code> or the 
                                related toolbar icon
                                <img class="icon" width="16" height="16"

                                The mouse-based selection works as expected, 
                                pointing to either glyph entities or section 
                                entities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In section-selection mode, section boundaries
                                are shown while these boundaries do not appear
                                in glyph-selection mode.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In glyph-selection mode, the selected
                                glyph may display links to its related 
                                translated entities.
                                The links appear as short straight lines (and 
                                are driven by the option <code>Views</code> | 
                                <code>Show glyph Translations</code>).

                                    In section mode, since entities are usually
                                    rather small, you don't need to click on

                    <p>Let us take the third error signalled in the error window (Dot 
                        unassigned).
                    </p>
                    <p>A dot-shaped glyph is expected to be assigned a precise 
                        shape (augmentation dot, repeat dot, staccato) depending on
                        the surrounding entities.
                        Here none of these assignments was found acceptable.
                        It's a hint that the glyph <code>#3174</code> is perhaps not a 
                        dot.
                    </p>
                    <p>Simply let's click on this error, and the suspicious glyph gets
                        the global focus, as depicted by the image next to this
                        paragraph.
                    </p>
                    <p>Obviously, this glyph is not a dot. What is it? 
                        It seems to be part of a small half circle, which got cut by the
                        image border. Let's try to fix that, by "merging" the two parts
                        of the half circle.
                        <br/>
                        We select the two parts, for example by using a "lasso" as in:
                        <img width="139" height="46" src="../images/lasso.png" />
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the two glyphs are selected, we can click on the 
                        <code>SLUR</code> shape if it appears in the top 5 shapes of 
                        the Eval board. 
                        If not, we use a right-click to get the context popup menu
                        <code>Glyphs...</code> | 
                        <code>Build compound as...</code> | <code>Physicals</code> |
                        <code>SLUR</code>.</p>
                    <p>The two parts are now merged in a single glyph, which is assigned
                        the <code>SLUR</code> shape.</p>

                    <p>The previous section (using a glyph merge) has already used a 
                        glyph assignment (via Eval board or context menu).</p>
                    <p>Let's recap the various assignments ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evaluation board, by clicking in one of the top 5 shapes
                            proposed.</li>
                        <li>Context menu, by navigating to the desired shape by
                            <code>Glyphs...</code> | <code>Assign glyph as...</code>
                            | etc,

                        </li>
                        <li>Shape palette. In the Shape board, open the proper shape
                            set, and use a double-click on the desired shape.
                        </li>
                        <li>Copy / paste a shape from one glyph to another. 
                            Use the context menu on the first glyph and select 
                            <code>Glyphs...</code> | <code>Copy &lt;SHAPE&gt;</code>,
                            then use the context menu on the other glyph and select
                            <code>Glyphs...</code> | <code>Paste &lt;SHAPE&gt;</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We can add another way, using the Glyph board, since clicking
                        on the <code class="button">Deassign</code> button

                    <p>
                        Since sections are usually small, the selection gesture is a bit
                        simplified when compared to glyph selection:
                        You don't even have to release the mouse button when moving from
                        one section to the other, simply browse the sections as you 
                        would do with an eraser, and all the touched sections will be
                        added to the selection in a "greedy" mode.
                        To really remove a given
                        section from the current selection, release the mouse button and
                        press down the button again on the section to remove (always
                        keeping the <code class="key">CTRL</code> key pressed).
                        <br/>
                        Note, as you select the sections of the "eighth rest" portion of
                        the glyph, that the Eval board continuously tries to recognize
                        a shape out of the selected sections. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you have selected all the sections that compose the eighth 
                        rest, the <code class="button">EIGHTH_REST</code> button
                        should appear in the top 5.
                        <br/>
                        Simply click on the related button, and the shape is assigned 
                        to a new glyph composed of the selected sections.

                        a right click to open the context popup menu and use the

                        In the section above, we have been lucky that the separation 
                        between the two glyphs could be found by aggregating sections. 
                        But these splits on section borders are not always satisfactory.
                        In that case, the solution is to inject the needed glyphs 
                        directly into the sheet structure.

                    <p>
                        For the sake of example, let's suppose that the split above had
                        not been performed. 
                        So, we still have this big glyph instead of clearly
                        separated flag glyph and eighth rest glyph. So we'll inject them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First let's get rid of assigned shapes (<code>FLAG_1</code> and
                        <code>SLUR</code>), by using the 
                        <code class="button">Deassign</code> button,
                        until no more shape is assigned.
                        <br/>
                        Note that when a shape is manually deassigned, the program tries
                        to assign another shape, hence the need for perhaps multiple
                        deassignments.
                        We could also directly assign a <code>CLUTTER</code> shape, to
                        avoid these multiple deassignments.
                        The picture presents the "cleaned" glyph.

                         src="../images/chula-dragged-flag.png" />
                    <p>
                        In the shape palette, we now select the range dedicated to
                        flags, and then drag the suitable flag shape from the palette 
                        to the sheet view. 
                        In the picture, you can see the ghost image of the flag 
                        being dragged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We pay attention to correctly position the flag along the stem,
                        and we release the mouse button.

                    <p>
                        We perform a similar action for the eighth rest, and we have
                        reached the final result.

                    <p>
                        Just a couple of remarks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For certain shapes, like the flag, it is important to 
                            position the glyph with a rather good precision, otherwise 
                            the distance between the stem and this flag may be larger 
                            than the tolerated margin, and the stem and the flag will 
                            not be recognized as connected.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the time being, the DnD is rudimentary: once a glyph has
                            been dropped, it cannot be moved. The only workaround is to 
                            delete this virtual glyph (by deassigning it) and reperform
                            the DnD.
                        </li>

                        <li>Another current limitation is that there is yet no way to
                            resize a virtual glyph. So DnD does not really work for such
                            shapes as beams, slurs, crescendos, descrescendos, ... 
                            These moving / resizing features are postponed until we 
                            integrate a more powerful way to play with glyphs and shape 
                            display (certainly the NetBeans Visual Lib).

                        Text-shaped items are processed by the OCR engine to retrieve
                        their actual content.

                    <p>
                        Make sure to select the proper language to get the best OCR 
                        results.
                        You can still change the language afterwards to automatically
                        recall OCR on the detected words, but the best results are 
                        achieved when the right language is chosen upfront.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even with proper language selected, some texts are not correctly
                        OCR'ed.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Chula example at hand, the number "<code>31</code>"
                            was not detected in the upper right corner. 
                            The solution is to select the glyph by a "lasso" and assign
                            the TEXT shape. This triggers the OCR, which should 
                            recognize the proper digits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some words may be assigned a wrong OCR value.
                            To fix this, select the related glyph and in the text field
                            of the Glyph board, directly type the correct word value. 
                            You can also modify other attributes of the textual glyph,
                            such as the text role or the text type.

                        Actually, one of the objectives of Audiveris 4.2 release
                        was to be able to process these former Recordare

                        manual processing was still necessary.

Parameters syntax:
   [-help]                             Prints help about command line interface and stops
   [-batch]                            Specifies to run with no graphic user interface
   [-step (STEPNAME|@STEPLIST)+]       Defines a series of target steps
   [-option (KEY=VALUE|@OPTIONLIST)+]  Defines a series of key=value constant pairs
   [-script (SCRIPTNAME|@SCRIPTLIST)+] Defines a series of script files to run

   [-export (DIRNAME|FILENAME)]        Defines an output path to MusicXML file (or directory)
       
Known step names are in order (non case-sensitive):
   LOAD        : Reload the sheet picture
   SCALE       : Compute general scale
   GRID        : Retrieve the grid of all systems
   SYSTEMS     : Split all data per system
   MEASURES    : Retrieve Measures from Bar sticks
   TEXTS       : Retrieve texts items in each system area
   STICKS      : Extract vertical & horizontal sticks
   SYMBOLS     : Apply specific glyph patterns
   PAGES       : Translate glyphs to score items
   SCORE       : Merge all pages into one score

   PRINT       : Write the output PDF file
   EXPORT      : Export the score to MusicXML file
   PLUGIN      : Launch the default plugin (MuseScore)

                    <p>You can also use the executables named <code>audiveris.exe</code>
                        or <code>audiveris-console.exe</code> which are just wrappers 
                        around the <code>java</code> command.
                        This command line syntax is also correct: 
                        <code>audiveris.exe [parameters*]</code>, it takes the JVM 
                        options declared in the related file

                    <p>
                        The picture represents a typical Options view:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We are in the package named <code>util</code>, (actually, 
                            its full name is <code>omr.util</code>, but we drop
                            the ubiquitous <code>omr.</code> prefix) and the class named
                            <code>OmrExecutors</code>, in charge of the tasks handling.
                        </li>
                        <li>This class has a logging level, currently assigned to 
                            <code>INFO</code>. This information comes from the
                            <code>settings/logging.properties</code> file, but can be 
                            modified on the fly, thanks to this interface, to any
                            legal logging value (such as DEBUG, INFO, etc...).
                            <br/>
                            <b>NOTA</b>: these logging level modifications are meant
                            to be temporary, and thus not stored on disk. For persistent 
                            modification, please edit the logging property file directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>The class also contains some logical constants, which are
                            application-level parameters, whose precise value is kept 
                            separate from the algorithmic code. 
                            <br/>
                            For example, the constant <code>useParallelism</code> 
                            is an instance of <code>Constant.Boolean</code> class.
                            If set to true (its default value) it allows to take
                            advantage of all physical processors available.
                        </li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>To ease the retrieval of pertinent constants, you can use the
                        search field located in the upper part of the Options window.
                        Here, we have just entered the string "parallel" in this field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How do we define the current value of such logical constant?
                        The JavaDoc of class <code>omr.constant.ConstantManager</code>
                        explains the mechanism in details. 
                        In short, the overriding sequence is defined as follows, from 
                        lower to higher priority:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>SOURCE: The default value as defined in the source code,
                        </li>
                        <li>USER: The value, if any, found in file <code>
                                run.properties</code>,
                        </li>
                        <li>CLI: The value, if any, specified in the command line by a
                            <code>-option key=value</code>. 
                            The CLI value is persisted in the USER file when running in 
                            interactive mode, and not persisted when running in batch.
                        </li>
                        <li>UI: The value, if any, specified through the 
                            <code>Tools</code> | <code>Options</code> user interface. 
                            These UI values are persisted in the USER file.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If ever you want to get back to the SOURCE value of a 
                        constant, and discard the modifications you have made,
                        simply check the related box in the Log/Modif column.
                    </p>
                    <p>To restore the SOURCE value for <b>all</b> constants,
                        use the <code class="button">Reset</code>  button 
                        located at the top of the Options window.

                        Audiveris has the ability to train the underlying Neural Network

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the program is released with a pre-trained evaluator
                        so the casual user can safely ignore this training section.
                        However, if the score(s) you want to transcribe use some 
                        specific music font significantly different from the provided
                        examples, you may consider training the evaluator to better fit
                        your case.

                        You can set a mode in which any manual assignment will be saved
                        as a training sample. 
                        This allows to record any isolated sample on the fly and thus make
                        it available for a future training of the shape evaluator.
                        <br/>

                        This mode is disabled by default.
                        To enable the feature, use the
                        menu item <code>Tools</code> | <code>Persist Manuals</code>.
                        From that point on, any manually assigned glyph will be saved,
                        until the program is exited or the mode is manually reset.

                        Another possibility, when you are really confident with
                        all the glyphs recognized in the current sheet, is to 
                        save as a whole the complete set of glyphs as training 
                        samples.

                        This data is saved under the <code>/train/sheets</code>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>NOTA:</b> This possibility is very powerful but
                        requires a careful manual inspection beforehand.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this "Sample Verifier" is to provide a user 
                        interface to visually review some or all of the
                        various glyphs which are used for training the evaluator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The main objective is thus to easily identify samples which have
                        been assigned a wrong shape. 
                        Using them as part of the training base could severely impact
                        the recognition efficiency of the evaluator. 
                        So the strategy, when such a wrong glyph has been identified, 
                        is simply to delete the glyph from the base.

                        <dt>Folders<dt>

                        display of the selected glyphs, using their own coordinates. 
                        Notice that glyphs that belong to separate sheets can happen to 
                        have close coordinates and thus be displayed as overlapping 
                        glyphs.

                            appears on the main Audiveris windows, is used to display 
                            information about the glyph at hand, together with the

                            The <code class="button">Remove</code> button can 
                            be used to discard a wrong glyph: 
                            this is implemented through the mere deletion of the 
                            underlying glyph XML file.

                        By default, this user interface looks for glyphs files under

                        Before any digital processing can take place, each pixel must be
                        extracted from the image and flagged as either foreground or 
                        background:

                        <li>
                            The default binarization filter uses a <b>global</b> 
                            approach, based on a single threshold value for all pixels 
                            of the image. 
                            All pixels with a gray level which is less than or equal to
                            the threshold are considered as foreground, the others as 
                            background.
                            This approach assumes that the image illumination is 
                            rather uniform.

                        <li>
                            For images with non-uniform illumination, you can select an
                            <b>adaptive</b> filter, which determines the threshold value
                            for each pixel individually, by using mean value and 
                            standard deviation in a small window around the pixel at

                        Now that it can pick up just the foreground pixels, 
                        the program can aggregate them into vertical runs.
                        And simply by analyzing the histograms of run lengths for 
                        foreground pixels (and for background pixels as well), it
                        retrieves key information about the music sheet.

                        Via <code>File</code> | <code>Display Scale Plots</code> you
                        can display both histograms.

                    <p>In this example, the foreground histogram indicates a peak at 
                        value <code>3</code>
                        which corresponds to the mean staff line thickness.</p>
                    <p>If there is no peak above the <code>10%</code> quorum, the image
                        is not likely to contain music staves.</p>
                    <p>The sharpness of this peak is also a good indication of the
                        scan quality and the width at <code>15%</code> is used to define
                        line margins.
                    </p>
                    <p>The second foreground peak value at <code>12</code> is the second
                        frequent height and thus corresponds to average beam height.

                    <p>Similarly, the main background peak at <code>18</code> relates
                        to the average background distance from one staff line to the
                        other.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adding foreground peak value <code>3</code> and background 
                        peak value <code>18</code> leads to <code>21</code>, which
                        is now considered as the main interline value and thus the 
                        key scaling factor for the sheet at hand.

                    <p>By aggregating long horizontal sections into filaments, and
                        gathering them into clusters of vertically spaced

                    <p>
                        Similarly, long vertical sections are aggregated into barline 
                        filaments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The crossing of these horizontal and vertical filaments, 
                        sometimes fairly wavy, represents a kind of "grid".
                        Because such filaments are often far from being straight lines,
                        they are implemented as natural splines (sequences of bezier
                        curves with continuity up to the second derivative).
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        From that point on, this grid is taken as the geometric 
                        referential for all other entities.
                        Note that this intrinsic referential allows Audiveris to 
                        directly cope with skewed page and / or wavy lines with no
                        deskewing or other processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish, you can still ask Audiveris to produce a "dewarped"
                        image, by using the referential as the dewarping grid.
                        Doing so, Audiveris <code>GRID</code> step can also be used as
                        a standalone image dewarping preprocessor.
                        <br/>
                        To compute and display the dewarped image, simply set the 
                        constant <code>omr.grid.GridBuilder.buildDewarpedTarget</code>
                        to true, 
                        and to save the dewarped image to disk set the constant 
                        <code>omr.grid.TargetBuilder.storeDewarp</code> to true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See below the differences between the initial (warped) 
                        image and the final (dewarped) image. 
                        Note the pixels colors are not modified, only their 
                        coordinates are.

                        systems which assigns the glyphs to the system they logically
                        belong to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can still manually modify the border, by starting a boundary
                        edition session via the (right-click) context menu
                        <code>Boundaries...</code> | <code>Start</code>.
                        The broken lines of all boundaries are highlighted in red color.
                        With the mouse, you can adjust the border by simply dragging the
                        lines and points.
                        When you are done, end the session by 
                        <code>Boundaries...</code> | <code>Complete</code> so that
                        modifications are immediately taken into account.
