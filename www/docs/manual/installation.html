        <p>
            The latest version is always available on the <a href=

        </p>
        <p>
            There are two distribution per release:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>binary</strong> distribution which provides the
            needed binary components to run the program. Example:
            audiveris-3.2a-bin-20090925.zip
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>full</strong> distribution which, besides the binary
            components, provides source code, JavaDoc, build procedures,
            training material, etc. that is all the source items to modify and
            rebuild the program. Example: audiveris-3.2a-full-20090925.zip
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Just grab your distribution of choice and expand the archive into
            some directory. Nota: If you are interested in previous releases,
            you can browse the "archives" subfolder of the download area.

            <li>
                <b>OS</b>: Audiveris is essentially a Java application, and as
                such should be usable on a wide variety of platforms. It is
                today being developed under <b>Windows</b> and tested under
                <b>Mac&nbsp;OS</b>, <b>Solaris</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
                <p>

                    Note however that, since release 3.2a, Audiveris uses
                    <strong>Google Tesseract OCR</strong> for the translation of
                    textual glyphs. Tesseract was developed in C++, and as such
                    its use is OS-dependent. Please refer to the <a href=
                    "#Tesseract">Tesseract OCR</a> section below.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Java</b>: <b>Java&nbsp;6</b> is highly recommended since it
                already contains the <b>JAXB&nbsp;2</b> component which is
                needed for XML persistency. If you cannot use Java 6, you can
                use <b>Java&nbsp;5</b> but you will have to download
                <b>JAXB&nbsp;2</b> from the <a href=
                "https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB web site</a> and install it
                on your own.

        <p>

            Tesseract OCR is a C++ program and Audiveris is a Java application.
            For the time being, the connection between Audiveris and Tesseract
            has been implemented for Windows only. (Help would be appreciated
            from people knowledgeable about this kind of connection).
        </p>
        <p>
            For <strong>Windows</strong> environment, the Tesseract
            "tessdll.dll" component is used, via the Tesjeract Java companion.
            The Tesseract part needs two specific actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The installation of <strong>Microsoft VC++ 2008</strong>. You
            can use the express edition which is free. VC++ 2005 won't do the
            job, since we need msvcp90d.dll.<br />

                If VC++ 2008 is not installed, Audiveris will complain when
                accessing OCR the first time, with a message such as: "<i>Error
                while loading tessdll.dll</i>" or "<i>Error while loading
                tesjeract.dll</i>"
            </li>
            <li>The definition of a system environment variable, named <strong>
                TESSDATA_PREFIX</strong>, and whose value must be
                <strong>&lt;install-dir&gt;/ocr/</strong>, including the final
                "/" or "\" character. For example, my TESSDATA_PREFIX variable
                has this value: "u:\soft\audiveris\ocr\", without the quotes.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            For <strong>non-Windows</strong> environments, since the connection
            is not available yet, there will be a warning the first time the
            OCR class is accessed, but the program will keep on running,
            without the OCR features (the user will have to enter the text
            content manually).
        </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="OTHER_COMPONENTS" id="OTHER_COMPONENTS">Other
            components</a>
        </h3>

        <p>
            All the other components need no special installation procedure,
            since their jar files are already provided in the
            <strong>dist/lib</strong> folder of the Audiveris installation
            directory and directly referenced from the manifest of the
            Audiveris jar file. See the Implementation manual if you need more
            detailed information on these components.
