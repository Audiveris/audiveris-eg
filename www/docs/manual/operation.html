	    <H2>Possible Operations</H2>
	</A>
	
	<P>The purpose of this section is to identify and quickly present the
	    various operations that an end user may perform with
	    Audiveris. Additional details will be provided in the other sections
	    of this document.</P>

	<DL>
	    <DT>Get the scan of a sheet of music</DT>
	    <DD>
		<DIV CLASS="warningmessage">
		    Note that for the time being there is no direct link to any
		    scanning device. So if you don't have image files available,
		    you'll have to operate the scanner beforehand by yourself
		    and store the scanned image into a file that you'll read
		    from Audiveris.
		</DIV>
		Whatever the origin of the scan, please pay attention to:
		<DL>
		    <DT>The scan resolution</DT>
		    <DD>The best fit is around 300 DPI. Less than that results
			in glyphs hard to recognize. More than that result in
			huge waste of CPU.</DD>
		    
		    <DT>The image format</DT>
		    <DD>All the major formats can be used: GIF, PNG, BMP,
			etc. The only limits are imposed by the underlying JAI
			library (more details available on: XXX)</DD>
		    <DD>Try to get gray or black &amp; white images, where a
			pixel is stored on 1 byte. This is by far the most
			efficient configuration.</DD>
		</DL>
	    </DD>

	    <DT>Translate a sheet of music</DT>
	    <DD>The most common operation is to load a sheet image, let
		Audiveris run through the SCORE step, manually make some
		adjustments if needed, and then write the resulting score
		material into a file using MusicXML format.
	    </DD>
	    <DD>The automatic processing is organized in a sequence of <A
		href="#STEPS_SECTION">steps</A> which are detailed below. Every
		step, with the exception of <A href="#SCALE">SCALE</A>, has a
		related sheet view which provides visual feedback on what is
		being done. The user can modify the <A
		href="#OPTIONS">parameters</A> values used for a specific
		processing. The user can also directly modify the shape assigned
		to one or several glyphs, by selecting these glyphs and use menu
		items or buttons to modify the assignment.</DD>
	    
	    <DT>Run a script</DT>
	    <DD>A script defines a sequence of actions to be performed on a
		sheet. It is typically recorded as you manually interact with a
		sheet, and can be saved on disk.</DD>
	    <DD>At any time you can load a script file and it will run to its
		end. You can then go on and any action you'll perform on the
		sheet will be recorded as an additional task at the end of the
		script.</DD>
	    <DD><A href="#SCRIPTS">Scripts</A> can be run in batch mode as well
		as in interactive (non-batch) mode.</DD>

	    <DT>Train the evaluator</DT>
	    <DD>At the heart of Audiveris, a neural network is in charge of
		finding the best shape(s) to fit a given glyph.</DD>
	    <DD>Such a neural network needs to be properly trained, and the
		Audiveris distribution provides an already-trained version of
		it. However, the training is very dependent upon the diversity
		and the coverage of the training set. By manually assigning
		shapes, you can feed the trainer with additional data, and come
		up with a more performant evaluator.</DD>

	    <DT>Tune the application</DT>
	    <DD>Audiveris provides many ways to inspect intermediate results,
		through specific graphic charts, dedicated sheet views,
		context-dependent tables, etc.</DD>
	    <DD>There is no hard-coded constant in Audiveris code. All values
		are defined as "<I>logical constants</I>" and backed up on
		disk. A general purpose interface is available in interactive
		mode to browse these constants and modify them if so
		desired. Any new value is then made available for the current
		and the next runs of Audiveris.</DD>

	<A NAME="LAUNCHING_SECTION">
	    <H2>Launching Audiveris</H2>
	</A>
	
	<P>First, move to the directory where you've extracted the Audiveris
	    archive. Audiveris can be launched by different means:</P>
	<OL>
	    <LI>A double click on the jar file <u>audiveris-3.0.jar</u> located
		in the <u>bin</u> folder of the installation directory.</LI>
		<BR/>
	    <LI>Using the command line:
		<UL>
		    <LI>For a simple launch:
			<DIV CLASS="info">$&gt; java -jar
			    bin/audiveris-3.0.jar</DIV></LI> <BR/>
		    <LI>For a launch with additional JVM parameters (this
			example provides additional memory to the application):
			<DIV CLASS="info">$&gt; java -Xmx256m -jar
			    bin/audiveris-3.0.jar</DIV></LI> <BR/>
		    <LI>The full command line syntax is the following:

			convenient way to register these parameters</LI>
		    <LI>Using the <i>ant</i> utility from the <u>src</u> folder,
			and running the <b>run</b> target.</LI>
		    <LI>Using NetBeans IDE. For this, after creating a NetBeans
			project in the installation directory, you'll have first
			to rename the <u>build-for-netbeans.xml</u> file
			as <u>build.xml</u> and then ask NetBeans to launch the
			application.</LI>

	<A NAME="INTERACTIONS_SECTION">
	    <H2>Interactions</H2>
	</A>
	
	<A NAME="UI">
	    <H3>User Interface</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> Here is a quick presentation of the main user interface. This main
	    windows is organized as follows:
	    <UL>
		<LI>The top pane is dedicated to the <b><i><u>Score
		    View</u></i></b> of one sheet. We can have several sheets
		    opened, in that case there will be several sheets tabs. The
		    score view is organized horizontally, all systems are
		    presented one besides the other.</LI>
		<LI>In the center, there are several <b><i><u>Sheet
		    Views</u></i></b>, roughly one per step. All the sheet views
		    present the same organization of a sheet of music where the
		    various systems are located one above the other. The Picture
		    view is the original image (perhaps deskewed), while the
		    other ones display synthetic objects.</LI>
		<LI>The bottom left pane is the <b><i><u>Log Pane</u></i></b>
		    where all messages are logged.</LI>
		<LI>The bottom middle pane is the <b><i><u>Errors
		    Pane</u></i></b> where the set of translation errors are
		    displayed.</LI>
		<LI>The right pane of the window is used by the <b><i><u>Boards
		    Pane</u></i></b> which is a vertical assembly of boards. The
		    Boards Pane contant depends on the selected Sheet View. Here
		    are the various types of Boards available:
		    <UL>
			<LI><B>Pixel:</B> Displays the current position (point
			    or rectangle) in pixels in the sheet space. The
			    'Level' field is filled only in the Picture sheet
			    view, it gives the level of gray for the selected
			    pixel. Note that apart Level, all the other fields
			    are also input fields. Just modify their values and
			    press return to modify the selected location.</LI>
			<LI><B>Run:</B> Displays the current lag Run if any</LI>
			<LI><B>Section:</B> Display the current lag Section if
			    any, with parameters related to the section
			    itself. The Id field is both output and input, so a
			    Section can be directly selected via its ID. The 3
			    last fields (layer, dir and role) describe the
			    relation between this section and a Stick if
			    any</LI>
			<LI><B>Glyph:</B> Displays parameters of the selected
			    Glyph if any. The 'Id' field allows to browse all
			    glyphs, while the 'Known' field handles only the
			    glyphs with an assigned shape, and the 'Symb' field
			    the glyphs that are symbols. A glyph is collection
			    of sections, and it is never deleted. A glyph is
			    said 'Active' if its sections point back to it, so
			    the selection of one of its sections will select
			    that glyph. The current glyph shape is displayed,
			    both the graphic and the name of the shape, and a
			    button allows to deassign the shape at once.</LI>
			<LI><B>Focus:</B> Allows to browse the whole sheet for
			    specific shapes of glyphs. It also allows to switch
			    the sheet display for all glyphs, just the known
			    (shape assigned) or just the unknown ones, just the
			    translated (to score entity) or just the
			    untranslated ones.</LI>
			<LI><B>Neural:</B> Displays the result of the glyph
			    evaluation by the neural network, the 5 best shapes
			    are displayed, with their related doubt (1.0 is the
			    best value, infinity is the worst). The color gives
			    information about the decision made: green means an
			    accepted shape, red a non-accepted shape, red
			    background color indicates a shape manually
			    discarded.</LI>
			<LI><B>Check:</B> There are many different Check boards,
			    but they are all organized as a table which displays
			    a suite of checks and their results for the glyph at
			    hand.</LI>

	<DL>
	    <DT>Selection</DT>
	    <DD>An entity can be selected:
		<UL>
		    <LI>By <B>typing</B> its ID (section ID, glyph ID) in the
			proper board. The ID of a section, or the ID of a glyph
			never changes, whatever the actions performed on the
			sheet. This is the reason why many log or error messages
			use the glyph ID.</LI>
		    <LI>By <B>pointing</B> to it with the mouse in the sheet
			view (or in the score view). A left click selects a
			section (if there is one at this location) which in turn
			selects a glyph if this section is assigned to a
			glyph. Other glyphs can be added to the selection, by
			pressing the Control key while pointing to another glyph
			in the sheet view.</LI>
		    <LI>By using a <B>lasso</B>, a rectangle displayed by
			dragging the mouse (left button) in the sheet view while
			a Shift key is pressed. To be selected, the glyphs must
			be fully enclosed by the rectangle</LI>
		</UL>
	    </DD>
	    <DD>The current location is indicated by the crossing of vertical
		and horizontal brown lines. Note that the score view and the
		sheet view are synchronized regarding the location
		selection.</DD>
	    <DD>The coordinates of the selection are displayed in the
		Pixel board for the sheet view, while coordinates expressed as a
		SystemPoint are displayed just under the score view.</DD>
	    <DD>According to the current selection, the various boards have
		their content updated dynamically. In particular, the Neural
		board runs on the current selection and displays the best
		evaluations. Note that if several glyphs are selected, the
		evaluation is computed against a compound dynamically built from
		all the selected glyphs.</DD>

	<P> The loading and processing of a sheet produces a related script,

	<P> Here after is the script file which corresponds to the actions
	    performed on the 'Chula.png' sheet as described in the quick start
	    <A target="Pack" href="index.html?manual=example">example</A>.</P>
	<P> Its understanding is straightforward: the tag name defines an action
	    (step, assign, segment, deassign, export) associated with its proper
	    parameters. You can manually edit the script, but note that the
	    glyphs are designated via their ID, a simplistic solution to be
	    secured in a future release of Audiveris.</P>

	<P> The window is organized as follows: </P>
	<UL>
	    <LI>The left hand part is dedicated to the sheet display.
		<OL>
		    <LI>The <B>Sheet Panel</B> takes the largest area. It
			displays one view of the sheet, here this view is the
			original picture.</LI>
		    <LI>The <B>View Tabbed Pane</B> gathers all views on one
			sheet, and the tabs allow navigation between views.</LI>
		    <LI>The <B>Sheet Tabbed Pane</B> gathers all sheets
			currently in memory, with one tab per sheet.</LI>
		    <LI>All the different views of the same sheet share the same
			vertical <B>Logarithmic Slider</B>, which allows to set
			the display scale using a logarithmic scale (factors
			ranging from 1/8 to 16).</LI>
		</OL>
	    </LI>
	    <LI>The right hand part is the <B>Data Panel</B>, which provides
		various data boards related to the current sheet. Its content
		depends of the current view. For the view of the original
		picture in this example, only informations of the <I>"Pixel"</I>
		board are displayed: the x & y coordinate of the mouse
		position, as highlighted by the crossing of vertical and
		horizontal orange lines.</LI>
	    <LI>At the bottom of the window, the <B>Log Panel</B> displays the
		sequential log of messages.</LI>
	</UL>
	
	<P> In this example, we have a black and white image, so the grey level
	    of the current pixel is either 0 (black foreground) or 255 (white
	    background). The mouse is currently on a pixel of the C Clef, so the
	    "Pixel" board of the data panel reports a 0 value for abscissa 236
	    and ordinate 430.</P>
	
	<P> By dragging the mouse, while keeping the shift key pressed, we can
	    define a rectangle. The x and y values are the coordinates of the
	    upper left corner, and the width and height are the dimensions of
	    the defined rectangular area.</P>
	
	<BR/>
	<A NAME="SCALE">
	    <H3>Scale Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step aims at computing the general "scale" of the music sheet,
	    which is basically the average vertical distance between two staff
	    lines.</P>
	
	<P> To do so, we use a very simple algorithm, based on vertical runs of
	    foreground (black) pixels and vertical runs of background (white)
	    pixels.</P>
	
	<P> The black histogram gives the average line thickness, and the white
	    histogram the white interval between two staff lines. The interline
	    value is thus defined as the sum of these two values.</P>
	
	<P> This step has no related sheet view. But, using the
	    menu <I><U>File</U> &gt; <U>Scale Plot</U></I>, we get a separate
	    chart as displayed below:
	    <UL>
		<LI>The red histogram describes the lengths of the black runs,
		    with a sharp peak on value 3 for this example.</LI>
		<LI>The blue histogram displays the white runs, with also a peak
		    on value 18 for this sheet example.</LI>
	    </UL>
	    
	    <P> For this sheet example, the main interline value is thus 3 + 18
		= 21 pixels. And this value will drive the computation of nearly
		all parameters used in the recognition process.</P>
	</P>

	<BR/>
	<A NAME="SKEW">
	    <H3>Skew Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> The purpose of this step is to compute the average skew angle of the
	    staff lines for the whole sheet. This of course is just an average
	    value, since all staff lines may not be strictly parallel.</P>
	
	<P> If the absolute value of the computed slope exceeds a given
	    threshold, then the image is rotated (<I>de-skewed</I>) is the
	    opposite direction, so as to ease the later detection of vertical
	    and horizontal sticks.</P>
	
	<P> We can display the sheet view related to the skew computation, as in
	    the following picture. The <I>"common"</I> sections are colorized in
	    colors close to green or blue, while the sections that compose
	    the <I>"significant"</I> horizontal sections are colorized in
	    red. We can notice that the staff lines are the main contributors to
	    the long horizontal section.</P>
	
	<P> Notice that the Data Panel exhibits two additional boards:
	    <OL>
		<LI>The <I>"Run"</I> board displays information about the run
		    designated by the mouse location. The run starts at abscissa
		    223 (we have horizontal runs in this view) and is 506 pixel
		    long. The average grey level along the run is 0, since here
		    it is made of only forground pixels with 0 as grey
		    level.</LI>
		<LI>The <I>"Section"</I> board displays data that pertains to
		    the current section (a section is a set of contiguous
		    runs). A section is given an <I>"Id"</I> to ease its future
		    handling. The fields
		    labelled <I>"X"</I>, <I>"Y"</I>, <I>"Width"</I>
		    and <I>"Height"</I> represent the bounding rectangle of this
		    (here horizontal) section. The fields
		    labelled <I>"Layer"</I> and <I>"Dir"</I> are actually not
		    used for this step.</LI>
	    </OL>
	</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/skew.png" TITLE="Sections for skew computation" />
	
	<P> We can also get the following chart, by using the
	    menu <I><U>File</U> &gt; <U>Skew Plot</U></I>:</P>
	
	<A NAME="SKEW_PLOT">

	<BR/>
	<A NAME="LINES">
	    <H3>Lines Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step is about staff lines, to properly detect all staff lines
	    and "remove" them from the sheet.</P>
	
	<P> The detection is driven by the horizontal projection of foreground
	    (black) pixels. A dedicated chart, displayed from
	    menu <I><U>File</U> &gt; <U>Line Plot</U></I>, makes this more
	    obvious as can be seen on the following chart. We use a threshold
	    (at roughly half the maximum histogram value, and indicated by a
	    vertical red line on the chart), and every regular series of 5 peaks
	    above this threshold defines the 5 stick areas supposed to contain
	    one staff line each.</P>
	
	<A NAME="LINE_PLOT">
	    <IMG SRC="../images/line-chart.png" TITLE="Histogram of horizontal

	</A>
	
	<P> The processing is then performed stick area per stick area. In such
	    area, we retrieve the long horizontal sticks that compose the staff
	    line.</P>
	
	<P> The detected lines are then cleaned up: The underlying pixels are
	    erased from the original picture, and a specific algorithm is used
	    to extend crossing objects (objects that were overlaid upon the
	    staff lines).</P>
	
	<P> The cleaned data is visible on the following view, where former
	    staff lines have been replaced by synthetic lines:</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/lines.png" TITLE="Staff lines detected and cleaned

	<P> Note that we can use a toggle button to switch between:

		<LI>The display of synthetic lines and of extended crossing

	<A NAME="HORIZONTALS">
	    <H3>Horizontal Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step retrieves and remove the horizontal sticks that are
	    recognized as ledgers of alternate endings. The following figure
	    shows that the ledger for a 'A' note has been removed and the two
	    parts of the note head have been properly joined into one glyph (a
	    black note head.</P>

	<A NAME="BARS">
	    <H3>Bars Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step retrieves and does not remove the vertical sticks that are
	    recognized as bar lines (either thick or thin bar lines). Notice in
	    the following figure that the glyph of the bar line is properly
	    assigned the shape name "THIN_BAR_LINE".</P>

	<BR/>
	<A NAME="SYMBOLS">
	    <H3>Symbols Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> In this step, browsing through the yet unassigned sections, we
	    aggregate connected sections into symbol glyphs, and try to
	    recognize these symbols. This of course works only for symbols with
	    a rather fixed appearance, such as clefs or time signatures on the
	    following picture, it does not work for constructions like notes
	    with stem, chords, etc...</P>
	<P> For example, we have correctly recognized "BRACE", "G_CLEF",
	    "G_CLEF_OTTAVA_BASSA", "TIME_TWO_FOUR" and "DOT". Note that we also
	    have mistaken some capital letters (F and P) with PIANO signs. To
	    improve this, we'll need to better train the evaluators and/or
	    properly isolate lines of text (lyrics or others).</P>
	
	<P> The mouse is currently on the second clef, and notice that the two
	    evaluators (called Neural and Regression) agree on acceptable
	    interpretation (notified with green color) as a
	    "G_CLEF_OTTAVA_BASSA".</P>

	<A NAME="SYMBOLS_COMPOUNDS">
	    <H3>Symbols_Compounds Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step focuses on non-recognized glyphs that may be the result of
	    undesired segmentation. This frequently occurs because of staff line
	    removal for symbols such as F clef or common time signature.</P>
	
	<P> The algorithm used is to browse through all unknown glyphs, ordered
	    by decreasing weight, and to try to aggregate neighbours that are
	    other unknown glyphs of the same system. If the result of this
	    combination leads to some recognized symbol, then we keep it as a
	    (compound) glyph. Otherwise, we don't keep the compound.</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/common.png" width="200px" TITLE="Common time symbol
							     segmented" />
	
	<P> The image above exhibits a segmented common time symbol: because of
	    the staff line removal, the initial symbol had been segmented into 3
	    parts, and nothing has been recognized (everything is displayed in
	    red color). The "symbols_compounds" step has aggregated 2 parts and
	    the result has been recognized as a common sign, as displayed on the
	    following image (notice the non-red color, that signals a recognized
	    glyph).</P>

								      time
								      symbol as

	     />
	
	<P> There is an obvious limitation in the current algorithm, which deals
	    only with 2-part compounds: we should be able to try more complex
	    compounds (here, we typically need the ability to make a 3-part
	    compound).</P>
	
	
	<BR/>
	<A NAME="VERTICALS">
	    <H3>Verticals Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This step aims at retrieving all the vertical sticks which are
	    either stems, or vertical parts of alternate endings. (Nota: just
	    the stems are extracted for the time being).</P>
	
	<P> The following image shows the various stems detected, displayed in
	    yellow color, each stem with its bounding box, and main line.</P>
	
	<P> Notice also that right pointing on a retrieved stem (or on just a
	    candidate stem, still displayed in red) displays a "Filter" board
	    with the detailed result of stem tests.</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/verticals.png" TITLE="Retrieval of vertical sticks"
	     />
	
	<P> If you select again the "Glyphs" view, you'll notice that the former

	<BR/>
	<A NAME="LEAVES">
	    <H3>Leaves Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> The stem extraction has led to the creation of numerous "leaves",
	    which we now try to assign a shape to. The "Leaves" step thus
	    recognized all the individual leaves of the following image (most of
	    the time, these leaves are note heads, or flags, or beams).</P>

	    apply another compound step, to recompose these leaves.</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/void_notehead-segmented.png" TITLE="Void notehead

	<BR/>
	<A NAME="CLEANUP">
	    <H3>Cleanup Step</H3>
	</A>
	
	<P> This is a final cleaning up step, focused on wrong stems. For
	    example, accidentals such as sharps, naturals or flats are symbols
	    which actually contain one or two (small) stems. If these symbols
	    are not recognized during the SYMBOLS step, then their stems are
	    extracted and new leave glyphs are then tried, generally to no
	    avail.</P>
	
	<P> For the time being, we simply call these stems into questions. To do
	    so, we try to cancel any stem which has no connected recognized
	    leave. Then, we build new glyphs from these now unassigned
	    sections. If we get to recognized glyphs, then we keep these glyphs,
	    otherwise we "resurrect" the stems.</P>

	<P> The policy is to assign a color to a shape range. A shape range for

	<P> The purpose of this item is to provide a user interface to review

	    training the evaluators.</P>
	<P> The main objective is thus to easily identify glyphs which have been

	<P> Here is an example of the glyph verifier:</P>
	
	<IMG SRC="../images/training_material.png" TITLE="User Interface to

	<P> The top panels are dedicated to selectors, in that order:
	    <OL>
		<LI>The <B>Sheet</B> selector. It allows to select one or
		    several sheets from the base at hand (which by default is

		<LI>The <B>Shape</B> selector. Only the shapes that are
		    contained in the selected sheets in the Sheet selector are
		    displayed here. And you can select some or all shapes form
		    the displayed list.</LI>
		<LI>The <B>Glyph</B> selector. Similarly, only glyphs whose
		    shape is selected in selected sheets are displayed in the
		    list. You can manually select the glyph instances you want
		    to review.</LI>
	    </OL>
	    In the provided example, the user has selected all glyphs whose
	    shape is either "BRACE" or "COMBINING_FLAG_1_UP" in the sheets named
	    "hove" and "plaisir-1".</P>
	
	<P> The large panel, on the lower right side, is dedicated to the
	    display of the selected glyphs, using their own coordinates. Notice
	    that glyphs that belong to separate sheets, can thus happen to have
	    similar coordinates and thus be displayed as overlapping glyphs.</P>
	
	<P> The lower left panel is composed of two main parts:
	    <OL>
		<LI>The <B>Navigator</B> to drive the loading and display of

		    selectors. You can navigate through the loaded glyphs.</LI>
		<LI>The <B>Glyph</B> panel, similar to the one that appear on
		    the main Audiveris windows, is used to display information
		    about the glyph at hand, together with the evaluations
		    performed by the Neural Network evaluator. The "Deassign"
		    button can be used to discard a wrong glyph: this is
		    implemented through the mere deletion of the underlying

	<P> By default, this user interface looks for glyphs files under

	    (see that interface). In that latter case, the <B>Training

		    Constant.Double, whose current value is 0.5. A tip text is
		    displayed, which says "Peak threshold stated as a ration of
		    maximum histogram value". In other words, this defines the
		    threshold that indicates a staff line on the histogram built
		    with horizontal projections.</LI>

	<P>There is a predefined list of types available for such constants (for
	    details, please refer to the JavaDoc of class <A
	    HREF="https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/constant/Constant.html">Constant</A>)
	   :
	    <UL>
		<LI><I>Constant.Boolean</I></LI>
		<LI><I>Constant.Color</I></LI>
		<LI><I>Constant.Double</I></LI>
		<LI><I>Constant.Integer</I></LI>
		<LI><I>Constant.String</I></LI>
	    </UL>
	    All these Constant subtypes encapsulate values of their standard
	    counterpart, in other words a Constant.Boolean contains a Boolean
	    value, etc...
	    <P> Another possible type is <I>Scale.Fraction</I> which is a
		double, whose unit is the interline value. For example, in a
		sheet with interline value of 20 pixels, a Fraction of 0.15 will
		represent 3 pixels. It's a way to express a length regardless of
		the actual sheet interline value. In the Options window, when
		such a Fraction value is displayed, its counterpart in pixels is
		also displayed provided that the current sheet has already had
		its scale computed. Otherwise, just a question mark is
		displayed. Please refer to details in <A
		HREF="https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/sheet/Scale.html">Scale</A>
		JavaDoc.

	<P>How do we define the current value of such logical constant ? The
	    JavaDoc of class <A
	    HREF="https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/constant/ConstantManager.html">ConstantManager</A>
	    explains this mechanism in details. The sequence is defined as
	    follows:
	    <OL>
		<LI>First the value as defined in the source code,</LI>
		<LI>Then, if the constant name is found in the file
		    named <U>/config/run.default.properties</U>, the related
		    value is used.</LI>
		<LI>Finally, the user home directory may contain a file
		    named <U>audiveris.run.properties</U>. Is such file exists
		    and contains the constant name, then its related value is
		    taken for the constant. This last file is not meant to be
		    manually edited by a user, it is automatically updated each
		    time the user uses the <I><U>Options</U></I> interface to
		    modify a constant value, thus making the modification
		    persistent for the subsequent runs of the application.</LI>
