	    <H2>Launching Audiveris</H2>
	    
	    <P>Audiveris can be launched by two different means :</P>
	    <OL>
		<LI>Using the launch script
		    called <CODE><B>audiveris.bat</B></CODE> and
		    located in the <CODE><U>bin</U>/</CODE> directory
		    of Audiveris.
		    <PRE CLASS="info">

		<LI>Using ant with the <CODE><B>run</B></CODE> target
		    on the provided <CODE><B>build.xml</B></CODE> file
		    located in the root directory of Audiveris.

	    <DIV CLASS="warningmessage">
		<P CLASS="alert">Each of these means needs a properly
		defined classpath, that you must customize beforehand
		to fit your own characteristics.</P>
	    </DIV>
	    
	    <P> Since <CODE><B>build.xml</B></CODE> provides a target
		named <B>launcher</B> which generates the audiveris
		launcher based on the defined properties, it is
		recommanded to first update these environment
		properties (by editing the file
		named<CODE><B>build.properties</B></CODE> in
		the <CODE><U>config</U>/</CODE> directory) and
		generate that launcher. Then, selecting either
		launching means will use the same environment

	    <H3>Command-line arguments</H3>
	    
	    <P> Most of the time, there is no need for command-line

	    <P> To present the various operations, and the related
		user interface, we'll use a tour based on the usual
		sequence of processing steps, since nearly every step
		has a related view</P>

	    <A NAME="LOAD">
		<H3>Load Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> The following image represents the main window of user
		interface, just after a picture has been loaded </P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/load-annotated.png"
		 TITLE="General Window Structure" />

	    <P> The window is organized as follows : </P>
	    <UL>
		<LI>The left hand part is dedicated to the sheet display.
		    <OL>
			<LI>The <B>Sheet Panel</B> takes the largest
			    area. It displays one view of the sheet,
			    here this view is the original
			    picture.</LI>
			<LI>The <B>View Tabbed Pane</B> gathers all
			    views on one sheet, and the tabs allow
			    navigation between views.</LI>
			<LI>The <B>Sheet Tabbed Pane</B> gathers all
			    sheets currently in memory, with one tab
			    per sheet.</LI>
			<LI>All the different views of the same sheet
			    share the same vertical <B>Logarithmic
			    Slider</B>, which allows to set the
			    display scale using a logarithmic scale
			    (factors ranging from 1/8 to 16).</LI>
		    </OL>
		</LI>
		<LI>The right hand part is the <B>Data Panel</B>,
		    which provides various data boards related to the
		    current sheet. Its content depends of the current
		    view. For the view of the original picture in this
		    example, only informations of the <I>"Pixel"</I>
		    board are displayed : the x & y coordinate of the
		    mouse position, as highlighted by the crossing of
		    vertical and horizontal orange lines.</LI>
		<LI>At the bottom of the window, the <B>Log Panel</B>
		    displays the sequential log of messages.</LI>
	    </UL>

	    <P> In this example, we have a black and white image, so
		the grey level of the current pixel is either 0 (black
		foreground) or 255 (white background). The mouse is
		currently on a pixel of the C Clef, so the "Pixel"
		board of the data panel reports a 0 value for abscissa
		236 and ordinate 430.</P>

	    <P> By dragging the mouse, while keeping the shift key
		pressed, we can define a rectangle. The x and y values
		are the coordinates of the upper left corner, and the
		width and height are the dimensions of the defined
		rectangular area.</P>

	    <P></P><BR/>
	    <A HREF="#STEP_LIST">Back to Step List</A>
	    <BR/>
	    <A NAME="SCALE">
		<H3>Scale Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> This step aims at computing the general "scale" of the
		music sheet, which is basically the average vertical
		distance between two staff lines.</P>

	    <P> To do so, we use a very simple algorithm, based on
		vertical runs of foreground (black) pixels and
		vertical runs of background (white) pixels.</P>

	    <P> The black histogram gives the average line thickness,
		and the white histogram the white interval between two
		staff lines. The interline value is thus defined as
		the sum of these two values.</P>

	    <P> This step has no related sheet view. But, using the
		menu <I>Sheet &gt; Scale Plot</I>, we get a separate
		chart as displayed below :
		<UL>
		    <LI>The red histogram describes the lengths of the
		    black runs, with a sharp peak on value 3 for this
		    example.</LI>
		    <LI>The blue histogram displays the white runs,
		    with also a peak on value 18 for this sheet
		    example.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P> For this sheet example, the main interline value
		    is thus 3 + 18 = 21 pixels. And this value will
		    drive the computation of nearly all parameters
		    used in the recognition process.</P>
	    </P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/scale-chart.png"
		 TITLE="Histogram of run lengths" />

	    <P></P><BR/>
	    <A HREF="#STEP_LIST">Back to Step List</A>
	    <BR/>
	    <A NAME="SKEW">
		<H3>Skew Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> The purpose of this step is to compute the average
		skew angle of the staff lines for the whole
		sheet. This of course is just an average value, since
		all staff lines may not be strictly parallel.</P>

	    <P> If the absolute value of the computed slope exceeds a
		given threshold, then the image is rotated
		(<I>de-skewed</I>) is the opposite direction, so as to
		ease the later detection of vertical and horizontal
		sticks.</P>

	    <P> We can display the sheet view related to the skew
		computation, as in the following
		picture. The <I>"common"</I> sections are colorized in
		colors close to green or blue, while the sections that
		compose the <I>"significant"</I> horizontal sections
		are colorized in red. We can notice that the staff
		lines are the main contributors to the long horizontal
		section.</P>

	    <P> Notice that the Data Panel exhibits two additional
		boards :
		<OL>
		    <LI>The <I>"Run"</I> board displays information
			about the run designated by the mouse
			location. The run starts at abscissa 223 (we
			have horizontal runs in this view) and is 506
			pixel long. The average grey level along the
			run is 0, since here it is made of only
			forground pixels with 0 as grey level.</LI>
		    <LI>The <I>"Section"</I> board displays data that
			pertains to the current section (a section is
			a set of contiguous runs). A section is given
			an <I>"Id"</I> to ease its future
			handling. The fields
			labelled <I>"X"</I>, <I>"Y"</I>, <I>"Width"</I>
			and <I>"Height"</I> represent the bounding
			rectangle of this (here horizontal)
			section. The fields labelled <I>"Layer"</I>
			and <I>"Dir"</I> are actually not used for
			this step.</LI>
		</OL>
	    </P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/skew.png"
		 TITLE="Sections for skew computation" />

	    <P> We can also get the following chart, by using the
		menu <I>Sheet &gt; Skew Plot</I> :</P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/slope-chart.png"
		 TITLE="Histogram of main slopes" />

	    <BR/>
	    <A NAME="LINES">
		<H3>Lines Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> This step is about staff lines, to properly detect all
		staff lines and "remove" them from the sheet.</P>

	    <P> The detection is driven by the horizontal projection
		of foreground (black) pixels. A dedicated chart,
		displayed from menu <I>Sheet &gt; Line Plot</I>, makes
		this more obvious as can be seen on the following
		chart. We use a threshold (at roughly half the maximum
		histogram value, and indicated by a vertical red line
		on the chart), and every regular series of 5 peaks
		above this threshold defines the 5 stick areas
		supposed to contain one staff line each.</P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/line-chart.png"
		 TITLE="Histogram of horizontal projections" />

	    <P> The processing is then performed stick area per stick
		area. In such area, we retrieve the long horizontal
		sticks that compose the staff line.</P>

	    <P> The detected lines are then cleaned up : The
		underlying pixels are erased from the original
		picture, and a specific algorithm is used to extend
		crossing objects (objects that were overlaid upon the
		staff lines).</P>

	    <P> The cleaned data is visible on the following view,
		where former staff lines have been replaced by
		synthetic lines :</P>
	    
	    <IMG SRC="../images/lines.png"
		 TITLE="Staff lines detected and cleaned up" />

	    <P> Note that we can use a toggle button to switch between :
		<UL>
		    <LI>The display of the former line pixels
			(colorized in yellow),</LI>
		    <LI>The display of synthetic lines and of extended
			crossing objects.</LI>

	    <P> Here are two zoomed view of details from the sheet,
		first the original staff line pixels, then the
		resulting data, where line pixels have been removed,
		and crossing objects have been carefully extended
		(note the extension goes until the synthetic staff
		line) : </P>

	    <P> This step retrieves and remove the horizontal sticks

		for a 'A' note has been removed and the two parts of

	    </A>

	    <P> In this step, browsing through the yet unassigned
		sections, we aggregate connected sections into symbol
		glyphs, and try to recognize these symbols. This of
		course works only for symbols with a rather fixed
		appearance, such as clefs or time signatures on the
		following picture, it does not work for constructions
		like notes with stem, chords, etc...</P>
	    <P> For example, we have correctly recognized "BRACE",
		"G_CLEF", "G_CLEF_OTTAVA_BASSA", "TIME_TWO_FOUR" and
		"DOT". Note that we also have mistaken some capital
		letters (F and P) with PIANO signs. To improve this,
		we'll need to better train the evaluators and/or
		properly isolate lines of text (lyrics or others).</P>

	    <P> The mouse is currently on the second clef, and notice
		that the two evaluators (called Neural and Regression)
		agree on acceptable interpretation (notified with
		green color) as a "G_CLEF_OTTAVA_BASSA".</P>

	    <A NAME="SYMBOLS_COMPOUNDS">
		<H3>Symbols_Compounds Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> This step focuses on non-recognized glyphs that may be
	    the result of undesired segmentation. This frequently
	    occurs because of staff line removal for symbols such as
	    F clef or common time signature.</P>

	    <P> The algorithm used is to browse through all unknown
		glyphs, ordered by decreasing weight, and to try to
		aggregate neighbours that are other unknown glyphs of
		the same system. If the result of this combination
		leads to some recognized symbol, then we keep it as a
		(compound) glyph. Otherwise, we don't keep the
		compound.</P>

	    <IMG SRC="../images/common.png" width="200px"
		 TITLE="Common time symbol segmented" />

	    <P> The image above exhibits a segmented common time
		symbol : because of the staff line removal, the
		initial symbol had been segmented into 3 parts, and
		nothing has been recognized (everything is displayed
		in red color). The "symbols_compounds" step has
		aggregated 2 parts and the result has been recognized
		as a common sign, as displayed on the following image
		(notice the non-red color, that signals a recognized
		glyph).</P>

	    <IMG SRC="../images/common-compound.png" width="200px"
		 TITLE="Common time symbol as a compound" />

	    <P> There is an obvious limitation in the current
		algorithm, which deals only with 2-part compounds : we
		should be able to try more complex compounds (here, we
		typically need the ability to make a 3-part
		compound).</P>

	    <P> Just like symbols, leaves may have been unduely
		segmented. So the apply another compound step, to
		recompose these leaves.</P>

	    <P> The difference between the images above and below is

		<H3>Cleanup Step</H3>
	    </A>

	    <P> This is a final cleaning up step, focused on wrong
		stems. For example, accidentals such as sharps,
		naturals or flats are symbols which actually contain
		one or two (small) stems. If these symbols are not
		recognized during the SYMBOLS step, then their stems
		are extracted and new leave glyphs are then tried,
		generally to no avail.</P>

	    <P> For the time being, we simply call these stems into
		questions. To do so, we try to cancel any stem which
		has no connected recognized leave. Then, we build new
		glyphs from these now unassigned sections. If we get
		to recognized glyphs, then we keep these glyphs,
		otherwise we resurrect the stems.</P>
