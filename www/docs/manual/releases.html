			<UL>
			    <LI>This release is the result of the
				strong need to formally publish the
				Audiveris software, even though there
				are still many areas with lots of room
				for improvement. Publishing the
				software, with source code and a
				minimal documentation, was necessary
				to let other potential developers
				contribute to this project.</LI>
				<BR/>
			    
			    <LI> The 2.0 number for what appears as a
				first version stems from the fact
				that, prior to Audiveris, the author
				had built an OMR Ada prototype called
				OptiMusic. So, Audiveris is kind of
				version 2.</LI>
