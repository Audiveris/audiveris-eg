                                <LI>XML Mapping: We've dropped Castor for
                                    JiBX. JiBX is reported more performant,
                                    especially at startup, since the binding is
                                    pre-compiled directly in the class byte
                                    code. Moreover, JiBX is the XML mapper used
                                    by MusicXMLrep which we'll use to handle the
                                    mapping to MusicXML format. So instead of
                                    the Castor environment, the JiBX one must
                                    now be installed (see the <A

                                    workaround has been to simply drop HTML used
                                    by FilterBoard in favor of standard JGoodies

                                    focus on a single evaluator. Unless a major
                                    bug needs to be fixed, this release should
                                    conclude the 2.x series focused on symbol

                                    known as CLUTTER and STRUCTURE, so that
                                    evaluator can differentiate between a valid
                                    symbol and symbols that either should be
                                    discarded (Clutter) or kept for later leaves
                                    retrievals (Structure).</LI>
                                <LI>Extraction: Got rid of the Regression
                                    evaluator, and organized all recognition
                                    steps on the sole use of Neural Network
                                    evaluator.
                                    <LI>GUI: Simplified and rationalized the
                                        mouse events related to selection,
                                        lasso, etc... It is now possible to
                                        incrementally select several glyphs and
                                        process them globally. This eases the
                                        user actions when manual assignment is
                                        needed.</LI>

                                        besides the Whole glyph base, to
                                        speed-up the training of the neural
                                        network.</LI>
                                    <LI>Added the use of manifest parameters to
                                        automate the handling of tool name,
                                        version and build reference.</LI>
                                    <LI>Added in the Regression evaluator the
                                        ability to measure distance to a given
                                        shape, as a way to select members for
                                        the Core base.</LI>

                                    <LI>This release is the result of the strong
                                        need to formally publish the Audiveris
                                        software, even though there are still
                                        many areas with lots of room for
                                        improvement. Publishing the software,
                                        with source code and a minimal
                                        documentation, was necessary to let
                                        other potential developers contribute to
                                        this project.</LI>  <BR/>
                                    
                                    <LI> The 2.0 number for what appears as a
                                        first version stems from the fact that,
                                        prior to Audiveris, the author had built
                                        an OMR Ada prototype called
                                        OptiMusic. So, Audiveris is kind of
                                        version 2.</LI>
