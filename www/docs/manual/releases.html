                                <b>Ornaments</b>: All ornaments such as
                                grace notes, turns, mordents, etc should be
                                translated to proper score entities and
                                exported into the MusicXML stream. Today these
                                glyphs, though correctly recognized, are not
                                translated into score entities.

                                such as legato, staccato, accent, etc which
                                should also be recognized and translated.

                                <b>Score</b>: Ability to inject score entities
                                directly into the score view, providing a very
                                basic score editor, but allowing to alleviate
                                the limitation of glyph processing.

                                <b>Shape</b>: Use of a palette, instead of
                                current awkward menu hierarchy, to easily
                                select a shape for glyph shape assignment or
                                score entity injection.

                                <b>Score Display</b>: JavaFX could be used to
                                provide a much better display, animation and
                                interaction with the score. This could be a
                                sub-project on its own, handled by a team of
                                students for example.

                            new features. It exhibits a special focus on the
                            integration of the Tesseract public OCR to handle
                            all textual informations, and a significant

                                <b>Application</b>: We have switched to the
                                Swing Application Framework, in order to use a
                                standard approach for such tasks as:
                                application lifecycle, resources, actions,
                                session persistency,... all in an
                                OS-independent way. This framework is bypassed
                                when Audiveris runs in batch mode.

                                by user interaction. The former BARS step is

                                the Audiveris main window loads the sheet and

                                load, thanks to the PDFRenderer companion tool.

                                <b>Midi</b>: The user now has the ability to
                                select and playback just a sequence of
                                measures, besides the whole score.

                                <b>Patterns</b>: After automatic glyph
                                recognition, a series of tests are gathered in
                                various glyph patterns to handle specific cases
                                (slurs, beams hooks, sharps, naturals, broken
                                clefs, imposed time signatures, etc). Thus the
                                PATTERNS step replaces the former CLEANUP step.

                                <b>Score Layout</b>: The user can dynamically
                                change the layout of the score display, and
                                switch between a vertical layout (like the
                                original sheet) and a horizontal layout (more
                                like a timeline).

                                <b>Score Rebuild</b>: The user has the ability
                                to rebuild the score entities at any time. When
                                dealing with very large systems, one can also
                                disable the automatic score rebuild and perform
                                the rebuild manually later when the
                                modifications are completed.
                            </li>

                                <b>Section Selection</b>: Besides glyph
                                selection, the user can now select one or
                                several sections, thus building a glyph by
                                hand. This allows the splitting of glyphs at
                                section borders.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Similar Glyphs</b>: The user can now browse
                                through a sequence of glyphs "similar" to a
                                selected glyph. This is helpful when dealing
                                with similar cases all around a music sheet.
                                The "similarity" is handled by a specific
                                Linear Evaluator since a Neural Network is not
                                linear at all.

                                <b>Steps</b>: Some steps, the ones that follow
                                the SCORE step, are flagged as not mandatory
                                and can be re-performed at will.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>System Boundaries</b>: The boundaries of any
                                system area are now defined by broken lines,
                                that the user can modify by mouse movements.
                                This allows a more flexible definition of which
                                glyphs belong to a system.
                            </li>

                                <b>Text</b>: A whole hierarchy of text items is
                                now defined to precisely handle Lyrics as well
                                as Titles, Directions and the like. The actual
                                text content can be entered manually via the
                                glyph board and automatically via the OCR
                                mechanism.

                                JiBX. JiBX is reported more performant,
                                especially at startup, since the binding is
                                pre-compiled directly in the class byte code.
                                Moreover, JiBX is the XML mapper used by
                                MusicXMLrep which we'll use to handle the
                                mapping to MusicXML format. So instead of the
                                Castor environment, the JiBX one must now be

                            for improvement. Publishing the software, with

                            necessary to let other potential developers

                            <li>The 2.0 number for what appears as a first
                            version stems from the fact that, prior to
                            Audiveris, the author had built an OMR Ada
                            prototype called OptiMusic. So, Audiveris is kind
                            of version 2.
