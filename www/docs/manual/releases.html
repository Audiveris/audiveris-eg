			    <LI><u>Text</u>: A whole hierarchy of text items is

                                like this. Since then, all existing actions have

                                instruments. Interface with Xenoage player has

                                JiBX. JiBX is reported more performant,
                                especially at startup, since the binding is
                                pre-compiled directly in the class byte
                                code. Moreover, JiBX is the XML mapper used by
                                MusicXMLrep which we'll use to handle the
                                mapping to MusicXML format. So instead of the
                                Castor environment, the JiBX one must now be
                                installed (see the <A

                                fixed, this release should conclude the 2.x
                                series focused on symbol extraction.</LI>

                                glyph at hand (for example deassigning a stem
                                has important consequences, more than for a

                                were mistaken with real CVS tags in related

                                since even after current Sheet has been closed,
                                there is still a Sheet instance referenced with
                                Score, related views, etc... Workaround if
                                several Sheets have to be processed
                                interactively is to exit the application after

                            <LI><u>Documentation</u>: Because of JavaScript
                                building of doc frames, the "Back" and "Forward"
                                commands trigger duplicate frame loads. Function
                                is OK, but this flickering should be
                                avoided.</LI>
                            <LI><u>Java</u>: There is still half a dozen of

                                assignments, to be cleaned in a next

                            <LI>This release is the result of the strong need to
                                formally publish the Audiveris software, even
                                though there are still many areas with lots of
                                room for
                                
                                improvement. Publishing the software, with
                                source code and a minimal documentation, was
                                necessary to let other potential developers
                                contribute to this project.</LI>  <BR/>
                            
                            <LI> The 2.0 number for what appears as a first
                                version stems from the fact that, prior to
                                Audiveris, the author had built an OMR Ada
                                prototype called OptiMusic. So, Audiveris is
                                kind of version 2.</LI>
